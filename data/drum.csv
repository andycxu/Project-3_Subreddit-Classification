16,DRUM,Personal review TD-17kvx,"This TD17kvx drum set is kind of interesting because Roland never did drum that sort of in good quality that under 2000 dollars. I think this is a best Roland's best value for your money drum set they've made in years. but don't get me wrong the drumset is not perfect it has a lot of downsides. So I'm gonna go over the good and the bad in this review.

PRO

The drum rack; I love how compact it was. I love how the drum rack folded in half and then put it inside the box and was off on my way. it is amazing in this little drum rack wound takes a little space to manage. it also stays pretty well when playing hard not thing tips over

&amp;#x200B;

The kick drum; for me, it feels pretty much identical to me personally it's has a nice solid feel to it. it does sway a little bit while I'm playing but it not moving backward.  

&amp;#x200B;

The snare; It is a nice accurate snare that I think the engineer paid attention to on the rim that they made sure it wasn't overly tall sometimes. I think they got the height of everything down so it does feel really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Sound; the sound is pretty in good quality in this budget. they pay attention to the dynamic on each pad and the cymbal, especially on the snare pad, is accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

CON

The tom part; it's has two rims, one is the rubber rim and they have the annoying inner plastic rim. so when you have these two rims together it's only got like an 8-inch playing surface, everyone in a while your stick will accidentally hit the plastic rim it will make this annoying clinking.

to conclude 

This drum is pretty good for the one who looking for a drum that is of good quality but still not a high price to buy. it is the best kit for an intermediate drummer that lives in the apartment because it pretty much covers the sound dynamic in general. For the advanced drummer, I do not recommend it because feeling not close to the real drumset yet. I feel when it comes to jazz it is not pretty done good in the part of sound Quality.

1,DRUM,DoubleBass position question,"Hi guys,

I'm new to drums (1 year) and I really want to do metal songs. 
I'm working on double bass since 6 months now, I'm not consistent on my practice so I still have a long learning curve ahead. 
I'm practicing with DrumBeatOnline (DBO) academy and it's going good so far. 
I can do DB exercices up to 130bpm with good consistency on my feet.

But I'm really struggling with long period of doublebass, for exemple playing Overkill from Mot√∂rhead or Wanderer from Amon Amarth.

The issue are my hips, I know a lot of people recommend getting the hips just a little bit higher than knees and almost 90* angle for the legs but it doesn't feel right for me, so I'm a little bit higher (bottom of the throne at the same level with the top of my kneecap).

I'm doing leg motion because that's the only type I can right now, I don't have enough control to ankle motion, I don't practice enough to get into it and not really going higher than 130bpm anyways. 

After a couple of measures I'm king of uptight and tense and it hurt a bit.  
I watched a lot of video for doublebass technique but they are in majority for very high bpm and fitting for me.

TLDR : If anyone have hips blocking/hurting while doing DB with leg motion what helped you ? 

Thank you for those who read till the end despite my english !",1643075487

32,DRUM,Name a drummer from another country you think is underrated in your own,"For me, being from the States, I'd like to throw some love to the very reliable, and very cool, Dominic Howard of MUSE. The whole band is really good at what they do, and for some reason not a lot of Americans are aware of this. They got some radio play over here with Uprising, but beyond that they're not very well known. Oh, except for the kids into that twilight crap with the shiny vampires, which let's be honest, they like the band for all the wrong reasons. 

Don't let the simplicity of some of their sound fool you, Doms got some really tough parts, definitely a less is more kind of guy that can take it right to the edge of woah! But what makes him stand out to me is that not only is he a lefty, but he's open handed a lot of the time too. No this isn't necessarily a big deal but if your a drummer you know it can be harder than it looks. He's got some excellent hat work happening most of the time, and I just think he's an awesome drummer to emulate. Check out his live stuff, there's full concerts all over YouTube (their a band that would let everyone in if they could, so they don't rip content down often, and will sometimes even post it themselves), but an awesome thing to behold is Dom behind the kit during ""resistance""",1642330681

I am thinking of starting to learn drum. Not sure if there is a platform similar to iTalki (for people to learn language).
In that platform we can pick any tutor and pay+schedule on the platform. No need to contact the tutor privately. No need to pay in bulk for multiple lessons with a fixed date every week. Lessons will then be conducted via Skype or Zoom.

68,DRUM,Want your opinion between two electronic drums,"Hi everyone!

I'm looking to buy my first drum and was looking at the used market for electronic drum. Beside the obvious Alesis Nitro Mesh that's available on amazon, I found a [Vsound EDS907](https://www.livingmusicstores.com/products/sonic-drive-5-piece-digital-electronic-drum-kit) on Marketplace for the same price of a used Alesis nitro mesh. 

The obvious advantages for the EDS are that all toms are dual zone and the bass drum pad is much bigger, so it could eventually fit a double bass-drum. Only the snare is in mesh and the toms are rubber-made. Also, it looks like a chinese drum and I can't find many reviews, so I don't know the quality of the build or if it sounds good (without ez drummer or a software).

The Alesis has many reviews on youtube and it looks like a good kit expandable for a beginner. The bass drum pad is really small and it would require to buy a second one to put beside the hihat or a completly new bigger one with a new pedal. Also, the toms are single zone, so less ""options"". From what I hear, the Alesis module sounds nice and is very customisable.

Any suggestions, reviews on the EDS907? Any insight on my dilema? Please help me!!

Thanks!",1638650781

Sparks (Most my age, 33 and younger wouldn't know who they are, and not a lot of people from their heyday would either) 

They were one of those bands that made a few Waves decades ago, but not a whole lot came from it. But they are the best kind of band who just continues to power through for the love of the music.  They are badass. Total kind of culture club fused with Aerosmith, which sounds weird but it's truly unique, and good. Like Really good. The drums are incredibly powerful, and so well done. If you don't know Sparks, look up Big Boy, or Fill-er-up, which are two of their bigger more accessible songs to start with. Learn that intro to Big Boy, it is an unsung GOAT. 

Anyway they got a documentary on Netflix and I can't help but think ughh, here come the late ones to the party haha",1638214446

7,DRUM,Suggestions for good songs to teach a beginner?,"Hey all!   


I have a student who is relatively new when it comes to drum set. He can play a basic rock beat, and has a rudimentary understanding of notation and some music theory. I wanted to get some opinions on what songs you guys started learning when you were a newb, or in retrospect thought would've been good for a beginner after a few years of playing.   


# Now, BEFORE you all come with song suggestions which are just pop songs with a 4/4 rock beat 99% of the song, please try to consider suggesting songs that AREN'T just that! I know plenty of those, but I want some challenge too.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am looking for are songs with either:

* interesting yet simple fills
* interesting and original beats that aren't just rock beats
* sections that develop good coordination
* ...or influences from different genres.

One example that came to mind for me was [""Boku no Atama"" by Paul Gilbert](https://youtu.be/Cvg3Ke-9YC4?t=90). It has a regular, simple beat, but the drum fills are varied, creative, and rudimentary. The main beat also shifts from half to double time, and it's a clear recording which i easy to transcribe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please lend me your wisdom! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!",1637758638

[10-piece drumset](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Alesis/Nitro-Mesh-Special-Edition-10-Piece-Expanded-Electronic-Drum-Set-1500000332626.gc)

I do know that the 10-piece has an extra drum, most likely to take up more space, and more money than the 8-piece drum set but when it comes to learning new songs will that extra drum matter? Are there any songs that use and need the drum that the 10-piece have? I guess that‚Äôs just my question about it- will I need it or not later on as I progress in learning songs on the drum. Thank you so much for reading- I came down to these two choices looking for a drum set but if anyone else has any recommendations or advice feel free to tell me please.",1637672829

98,DRUM,Why don't people use drumless versions of a song to do drum covers?,"So there are multiple ways of doing a drum cover. Everyone does it differently and some do the drum cover on top of the original drums in the song. So the song will be playing and they will do the drum cover on top of the song playing. My question is why don't they use something like a drumless version of the song? And before you start typing ""But drumless versions of songs don't necessarily exist."" Well, check this out! Here are 3 examples of drumless version songs

I am posting this to ask some helps to buy drumset by you pro drummers.

I am a composer and drum beginner and trying to find a drumset for our new recording room. 

The style that I find is Radiohead drum style to be recorded in Ok computer.

I googled that in OK computer recording it used  Premier XPK cherry/rosewood in red lacquer by legendary drummer Phil Selway. 

So, I found some great condition's used drums Premier XPK drums set made in England in 90's but also new Premier XPK drum set made in China. 

I am wondering what is great choice for recording.

Used one is below link.

Lastly, if any recommendation for high quality recording would be helpful.

Any reply would be thankful.

Basically I have been playing drums for just over a decade and I only really have experience on acoustic kits but due to where I now live, I have to put the acoustic kit into storage and buy an electric kit. I'm not looking for a beginner kit but I'm looking to get the most bang for my buck.

I'm very drawn to the Alesis Crimson Kit as it looks pretty good for the price but I could definitely use some help.

Good velocity response (if that's actually what it is called) and the option to replace the hi hats with new ones I can place on a hi hat stand. These two things are a must.

Does the Crimson kit seem worth it to all of you electric kit users out there, and are my must-have points something the kit will allow?

Thanks guys!

11,DRUM,URGENT ADVICE REQUIRED,"Hey everyone,
I live in an apartment on the first floor (the garage is beneath me) and purchased an electronic drum kit (yamahadtx402k) a few months ago.
I am a full time chef and suffer from ADHD, anxiety and depression and due to the lockdown have been stuck at home without work, as the restaurant I work at is closed. I have been teaching myself how to play the drums and cope by playing the drums in the daytime and once I get obsessed with a song I play for 6-8 hours at a stretch. 
Since I began playing, the neighbours two floors above me have been knocking on my door to complain, even if I've been playing for half an hour.
They complain even if I play at 3pm, and say that they need to work from home. 
I have put a foam mat underneath the silent kick but I suspect that the tapping they hear is from the pads. I have no idea how to silence the kit further. 
Not playing has made me feel extremely depressed and I can't even get out of bed most days due to it. 

What should I do?",1630305679

43,DRUM,Please help me with my drumming.,"Hello. I‚Äôm pretty new to this drumming thing. I‚Äôve always wanted to learn how to play them becuase they just seemed like a really cool instrument to play. Even though i already play 4 others, i really just want to settle down and put as much time to this as possible. Though i‚Äôve been having some problems. I‚Äôve always wanted to play Burnout by Green Day becuase they are my favorite band and that‚Äôs one of my favorite songs by them. And it has a really cool/ fast drum solo that i can already play pretty good. But i‚Äôve been having some problems. My right hand playing the hi hat seems like it isn‚Äôt fast enough to play the 8th notes and when i do, it seems like i‚Äôm playing buzzes instead of fast singles. Even though i can play it with both of my hands alone, when i try to add my right foot for the kick it feels like everything‚Äôs just falls apart. My hi hat gets quieter and 8th notes just become so much worse and it feels like my kick drum is playing doubles that are wayyyy to fast for the song making me speed up entirely. But for some reason i can play the song if i don‚Äôt play 8th notes but instead i play quarter. For some reason i can‚Äôt add a video here with the text so i will make another post with me playing with quarter notes then 8th notes on the hi hat and you will see what i mean. So i was wondering if there was any technique for my right hand( which is what i think is causing the problem) to become for faster but still controlled, and any exsersizes for my foot (mostly the doubles) for it to not speed up my playing/be in sinc with my right hand. Thanks!",1629560967

I'm a student at the Royal Northern College of Music studying Popular Music. I'm looking to expand my teaching and wondered if anybody fancied taking online lessons (or in person if in Manchester, UK.) I have many years experience playing Pop, Rock, Jazz, big bands, theatre shows and with orchestras so I can help with anything! Lessons are tailored to you and we could work on a range of things, including grades, techniques, songs, sight reading, playing with a click, preparing for an audition and more! I already have a group of students and would love to keep teaching and inspiring, whether you're a brand new beginner or advanced!

25,DRUM,Tuning with Gadget,"
Hello fellow Drummers of RedIt :)

So... Once again it is long overdue to chanche my drumheads.. with this thought in mind, I startet to dig a bit deeper in the Internet about the topic of tuning drums and stumbled across tuning devices pretty fast.
I figured that it is kind of a science for its own.. since (with such devices) you can tune the drums to certain frequencies and even tones. 
 Unfortunately I have no big clue about tones, especially in relation to drums.(I barely know the basic-scale)

 I am wondering what kind of notes I shoul'd use to get my desired tones out of my drums..
Also, wich kind of heads should I prefer? 

I am looking for a short, sharp tone with a good amount of attack and a tiny tad of sustain. 
My setup is the following: 

S.C.S. Drums - Birch - 45¬∞ Bearing
8"", 10"", 14"" Toms
Pearl Export Floortom -Mahogany/Poplar- 45¬∞ 
16"" 

PDP Pacific  -Bassdrum - birch- 22"" 

Thanks",1623771164

When I‚Äôm recording my kit both the room mic and the close mic I feel like I‚Äôm getting way more wires than thwack.  If I adjust the tension to get the sound I want I feel like the wires linger for days.  Instagram has me buggin with all these snares where you get this great dynamic thwack with little to no wire sound yet they‚Äôre still there.

Ill note this isn‚Äôt a compressor issue as I‚Äôm well versed in how to add punch and control dynamics.  This is a question about the fundamental capturing of the sound.  In the room I feel like I‚Äôm hearing a lot of wire as well.

83,DRUM,Looking for a ride,"Hey guys, new here. Let's get straight to the point. 

I'm in a progressive metal band and a few of my influences love to play on the bell. I've absorbed this and straight sixteenth ride bell sections have become a staple of mine. 

I'm looking for a good ride that has a bell that really cuts. I want it to sound a bit sweet, like the Chris Adler ride bell vibe. I'm pretty poor but don't mind splashing out on a good cymbal, as I'm only using HCS series meinl ATM. 

I've been looking at the dark mega bell from Meinl but it just doesn't sound the way I want it, it too dark where as I want one which cuts. 

I'm pretty savvy with cymbals and am not brand specific, so I've been looking at a few others. I love everyone's dark cymbals but they are too quiet in a metal context. 

Thanks guys, happy drumming.",1622653031

Second, the request is this:
I need someone to play only the drums while singing this song: [Death Dance by Palaye Royale](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=OE5IAk-5_3k&amp;feature=share)

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you just overlay the audio, or if you have that sick ability of being able to sing whilst playing, in which case, very impressive.

I just need the vocals/drums separate from the rest of the instruments, and I can‚Äôt play drums, nor can I sing.",1619570727

Pearl used to sell a snare basket adapter SBA 1/3 but that's been discontinued for ages. Does anyone know of other cheap and sleek fixes aside from buying a new snare stand?

I tried foam noodle pieces but too soft. Hard rubber blocks might work but then I don't know where to find one in the size/shape I need and be able to stick it onto the basket securely.

95,DRUM,Question: what's the expected dexterity of a trained drummer/percussionist?,"Looking for an answer in terms of ""be able to do triplet 16th notes at 120 bpm,"" for example.

I know there's a continuum of limitations and it depends on the drummer, but I'm wondering if there's a universal standard?  For example, all marching band percussionists (specifically snare and quad players) should be able to sustain what seems like triplet 16th notes at 120 bpm, and in my years playing band (middle school through half of high school), I never read anything faster than that.  As a drummer, especially as one who's working on his double kick speed and control, I'm trying to figure out what my goal should be, and I figured that if my feet could match my hands, I'm probably in good shape, which led me to this question.

I'm sure some of you have come across some instructor, clinic, book, composer, etc., who maybe defined this?

A google search for fastest drummer led to Mike Mangini at 1203 bpm.  According to my math, that works out to almost directly in between 32nd and triplet 32nd (albeit a bit closer to the former) notes at 120 bpm.  Obviously, a standard drummer wouldn't be expected to have that kind of dexterity, but how much slower *would* the expectation be?",1615481873

47,DRUM,I wrote a drum method!,"Hey hey, r/DRUM! I'm Christian and I've been lurking for a bit, not sure how to contribute to the community here since I don't really do the drum cover thing. But I am a pro drummer, I play with that 80's band Bow Wow Wow, post lessons online, teach privately, etc. etc.

Anyway, I have this I can share today... I wrote a drum method book and it's being published by Wizdom Media Publishing, owned by Dom Famularo and Joe Bergamini!

The book is called *Paradiddlemania!*

The best part is that it will be distributed digitally on Hudson Music via their app, so the book will be interactive. You can click on an exercise to watch me play it, that sort of thing.

The pic is a proofreading draft I got for editing the engraving, text, etc. 

So, I'm also looking at different ways to reach out to the community (\*\*cough, sell some books, cough\*\*) and also help people work though the book.

I'm wondering what has worked for you guys. For example I'm thinking of starting a weekly live stream where I take people through the book the same way I would in lessons, which is organized slightly differently from how it's presented in the book.

Any other suggestions?

I pulled in &amp; the guy said his son doesn‚Äôt use them anymore - so now I want to do this set justice and learn the drums.

8,DRUM,Thinking towards upgrading my kit,"For my current set up I am really satisfied with my cymbals (Hats, 2 crash &amp; ride + stands) but all of the rest of it is old (my bass and toms(2 hanging+floor) are 10 year old cheaper starter kit junk) or broken (my snare had to be tightened ""on"" after the switch broke)

I am planning on replacing them all in the new year and a recent conversation with my band mates had me thinking about maybe going electric for the bass and toms. I like the idea of keeping my cymbals and snare acoustic as I fuck around with those to get various acoustic effects more often than I do with the toms, the big thing I want to be able to do with toms/bass drum is hit harder=louder. This would ensure I dont have to do tuning maintenance on the toms/bass and dont have to try to mic them for a live performance/recording or anything, it would also allow me to experiment with other effects for some songs.

Is this an absolutely stupid idea?
If it isnt, what recommendations for brand and supplier to buy bass trigger + 3-4 drum head triggers, the control system and the stands to hold them? A lot of the stuff I found online is for full kits(not suprising) and so I'm wondering where I could shop more ala carte?

tldr; is acoustic cymbals(hats, 2 crash, ride) and snare + electric bass and 3+toms a stupid idea and if not what/where to buy?",1608949649

And so we went upstairs to the drum area where there are electric kits to test out and such and since he was a beginner drummer who almost intermediate (played for 11 months) on an acoustic set and he didn't really know much about electric ones and so he went to the counter to ask for permission to play a kit with a double kick pedal (he loves tracks like one and hot for teacher and he wanted to get one of those double kicker pedals)
The guy gives us the green light and he sits on the set down, he starts playing a few songs (a bit botched but really great for 11 months) then a guy who is in his late 20s tells him he can't play and that he should stop it, we thought it was because of corona or something but there weren't any restrictions about the",1605910293

89,DRUM,Help needed for a hybrid drum set!,"Hello everyone!

I just bought a 5 pieces Mapex drum set with silent (L80) Zildjian cymbals, mesh heads and DDrums pro triggers.

I'm currently looking for a drum module to plug the triggers in, I've found the Yamaha DTX 502 to be relatively cheap and suitable to host 5 trigger inputs, though it is 5 years old.

I've also looked at sample pads but most of them do not have 5 triggers inputs, also they are quite pricey.

Would the DTX 502 be a good choice considering that I'm going to pay it 300 euros? Is there anything better worth the price?

Please do consider that I'm going to use it at home, so it will never have normal drum heads on :)

Thank you very much in advance!! :))",1605475389

20,DRUM,How to buy a drum? What are the ressources that are available?,"Hi!

I know very few things about drums, eventhough I've been playing for a long time. I think the best way to know if you like a drumset is to play it, and to hear it being played too.

  
However, I can't go and try every drumset that I find in the classified ads. I'm left with few informations: 

* brand/model;
   * This is probably important, but I have NO clue which brand is good or not. It seems like they all offer good and entry class drums. All I know is my first drum was not what I want (Westbury) ans my actual drum is good (Yamaha).
* dimensions;
   * This is a personal choice and I know what I want.
* pictures;
   * Obviously, it helps to know if you like the aesthetics too. I wouldn't buy a good sounding drum if I find it ugly.
* price asked.
   * This can be misleading as the person might not even know what they are selling, or they can ask way too much.

  
How would you guys know if a drum will sound good or not? Are there any reference online?

12,DRUM,"Hello! Why is Lars Ulrich from Metallica considered ""bad"" by so many people?","As I grew up, I used to listen to Metallica and I never really thought about the drummer. The drum simply kind of suit the style. When I think about it, I'd say there's even a signature drumming style that I associate with Metallica, which to me is really a good aspect of a drummer. If you can make people associate your style with you, it's probably because you're doing something unique, or refined.

However, since I am also very young, I've heard so many times that Lars is ""bad"". This is way before we could see Lars in multiple videos on internet, not playing, but just being himself, which I think didn't help the cause since I know people doesn't like his personality too.

What, in his drumming, could be considered bad? Where does this trend stems from?

Thank you!",1601476453

33,DRUM,Does the sound reflection of the room affect practice?,"I have noticed that some people may install some sound absorption stuff like acoustic foam and panels on their rooms to absorb different range of frequency of their drums. 

In my experience, I also found that it is more comfortable to listen to the drums if I practice in a room that is well-treated with sound aborption. I feel that it is much easier to listen to the mistakes I made and it helps improve my time, dynamic of my drumming. Otherwise, if I practice in a room that is untreated or not treated very well with sound relfection, there will be a lot of echoes and it is quite difficult for me to listen and play cleanly. 

Do you have similiar experience? Do you think that the sound relfection of the room really affect the practice result and we should make sure our room is well-treated with sound aborption?",1597888071

91,DRUM,Advice on drum purchase,"Hey guys! I'm looking to get back into drumming after not playing for 5 years. 

My old kit was a bit of a beast (vintage pearl) and I sold it a couple years back so I'm going into this with a clean slate. 

So far I've come across a used vbl bop kit and an older export. I'm personally leaning towards a smaller, tighter 4 piece kit, but I'm not against getting a 5-6 piece. I used to play heavier stuff but lately I've been listening to a lot of neo jazz and just want to get back on the kit as a fun side hobby. 

Space isn't an issue, neither is being quiet (thankfully) but I'm ultimately debating on whether I should lean towards a more standard rock kit, or if I should follow my gut and go with a small and tight bop kit.

Pros and cons would be great, and maybe even other recommendations of what to look into. Thanks!",1592981715

95,DRUM,Feel exhausted when drumming,"I have been playing drums since 15. I have played for 15 years. I practice for around 3 hours everyday. However, I started losing hand and leg strength few years ago.

I feel that my wrists and ankles do not have the strength as before and become exhausted easily. Sometimes, I can't even play a down stroke cause my wrists feel so weak.

This bothers me because I can't play the speed and loud touch that I could play before. This also affects my consistency, timing and coordibation. I also learn things  much slower that I used to. Do you experience the same problem? Is it about aging? If so, how do you get through this? Thanks.",1592791380

It's fair to say you should start at the bottom. I was thinking just starting with the snare drum, because then I can easily practice on my pad.

The thing is with all this COVID stuff it's largely online right now, but I don't like that idea. If someone is going to teach me I want to be in the same room when they hear me play so they can properly see what Im doing.

I use youtube videos too but if someone has something out there that's got a good structure to it I'd rather follow that. I don't want to just jump around arbitrarily through youtube vids.",1591555788

How I learned to mount a cymbal (bottom to top):

* cymbal washer in convex orientation
* felt
* cymbal
* felt
* wing nut

Seems like the top felt and the wing nut are missing in many kit pics, groove videos and drum covers.  Am I the only one noticing this?  Or have I been misled all these years for proper cymbal mounting?

The band were called Cat Iron, and the lead singer was doing this Roger Daltrey, throw the mic as high in the air as possible then catch it thingy. About 3 songs in, he threw the mic again, but had to backtrack like crazy as he threw it slightly behind him. Tripping on the drum riser and falling straight into the kit he scattered cymbals, stands, mics and floor toms across the stage (to much cheering of the crowd).

It took a rather embarrassing 10 - 15 minutes of silence (apart from the slow hand clapping) to rebuild the kit again before they could carry on.

Online I read that it is because I hold the sticks to tight, but why do I get blisters now, with my new drum sticks, and not with my older onces? Could it be that I just have get used to my newer sticks?¬†

If it is my technique. And I hold the sticks too tight, how do I loose my grip without my sticks slipping?¬†i watched tons of youtube videos and I think I got the right technique...

8,DRUM,Advice: rack tom hardware that won't slip?,"Hello all (again, second post in 2 days, sorry),

I have another question, this time hardware related.  I have a 5-piece Tama Starclassic Maple (2005), all toms are rack mounted (even the 15"" floor).  I'm using the omni ball rack tom hardware from Tama that I bought with my Tama Rockstar back in 1999, and it works great for my 10"" and 12"", but not the 15""...it slips significantly.  I like to keep my drums level, but the floor tom winds up sagging to a pretty terrible angle (like 30-ish degrees), which is, of course, terrible on the wrists after prolonged use.  Question: is there a fixed-tom mount that's compatible with the starcast mounting bracket/hoop?  Alternatively, is there a type of hardware that uses the omni ball but will more reliably stay in a fixed position?  Drilling into the virgin floor is certainly out of the question.  I am opento buying an extra snare stand for the floor, though it's not my preferred route.

Thanks!",1580250221

97,DRUM,Lost my first real kit last night,"I bought a silver wrapped Tama Rockstar kit a little more than 20 years ago. It was a fusion 5 piece with 10, 12, 14 toms and 22x20 bass. I didn't know much about kits, their care, or where to learn those things (some might argue that's still true).


This was the kit that I practiced on for pep band, then brought to church for youth group band, then started a mxpx cover band. I brought them with me when I got married and moved half way across the country, and found some random people needing a drummer for their hardcore group. I brought them with me when I got divorced and moved back across the country. I played in dozens of local punk bands, and once on warped tour. I kept playing on my own through my second marriage, and when I got them back after the second divorce, with the heads intentionally cut, I finally replaced the heads for the first time, and realized how beat to shit the shells were.


I decided to buy a new kit and that I'd learn how to refinish these old ones. I cleaned them and repaired what I could, but mostly they just sat in the corner, unplayed for 5 years.


Last week my girlfriend said 'finish them, or get rid of them'. I've grown to love my new kit even more, so I posted the Tama kit free on Craigslist. I had responses immediately. 


Last night I handed them off to someone wanting to start drumming, and it feels great!",1575562640

99,DRUM,kit suggestions,"Considering buying my first kit... not going to try to fool anyone here... as much as I know it doesn't make a ""difference"" - my first box to tick is aesthetics.  I know me, and if whatever the thing is looks cool, I'm more inclined to be interested in it.  That said, I know nothing of drums.  It's pretty over-whelming how many kinds of wood, types of skins, sizes - etc.  

So I guess I'm curious... what are the more versatile sizes?  I don't know how to play.  I listen to rock and will likely play along to my favorite albums and that's probably going to be the extent of my hobby.  I like the Catalina series by Gretsch.  The Rock set they have and the Maple 7 piece you may have seen on sweetwater or amazon.  There's also a beautiful pdp set on sweetwater.  The pdp set and the gretsch are both maple, and the same size toms/bass.  The gretsch is a 7 piece and the pdp is 5.  The gretsch rock set is mahogany - the bass drum has a greater diameter and less depth.

Brand names, fit and finish aside - assuming you were just going to tap along to the Cure and Joy Division a few days a week - what would you look for?

Bouncing back to the aesthetics thing... I'm getting older.  I'm trying to find hobbies that will give me some cardio.  It's not so much about being a good or even ""alright"" drummer - it's about getting my heart rate up, and if I can build a new skill in the process that's great.  I mean it's between this and a treadmill - I'm 1000% certain I'm more inclined to play around for half an hour than to power-walk in place.",1575519033

4,DRUM,E drums disturb my neighbours,"Hi drummers,

I recently upgraded my home studio with an e-drum kit (Alesis Nitro Mesh) and started playing excitedly and within minutes the lower floor neighbours came knocking.

I live in a 12-story apartment in germany. The building is probably about 30-40 years old, reinforced concrete according to [phorio.com](https://phorio.com).

I figured it must be the kick, because everything else seems quiet. I immediately started trying different stuff out, I started with adding an anti-vibration mat commonly used for washing machines. That didn't seem to work, and because I lack the ressources and skills for crafting the widely known tennisball-platform-method I got myself the Roland KT-10.

It arrived and I checked back with the neighbours and nope, didn't work at all. So now I put the whole kit on a multi-layered construction (floor - yoga mats - heavy shelf boards - anti-vibration mat - kick pedal), the kit sits on the shelf boards.

But I feel like it is probably still quite loud for my neighbours, I checked with a vibration meter app (by Bosch) and it was showing nothing when put on the floor next to the platform. But I don't trust it.

What do you think? Will this work, when even the KT-10 alone did seemingly nothing? What other options do I have? I don't want to go the Roland Noise Eater Route because it is just ridiculously expensive and I already spent more than I wanted on the whole setup. Is it even possible without disturbing my neighbours?

First of all I just want to mention that I think drumming is absolutely #%@&amp;ing nuts. As a guitar player I see drummer and I have no idea how you all keep track of everything, blows my mind. Anywho....

My reason for posting here is twofold, one is to find out the name of a technique or what piece of the kid is being used that I love the sound of and am currently obsessed with. The other is asking if folks have some other songs that have that same sound in them, I'd like to get a playlist going.

I'd really like to get back into playing drums but currently I live in a small apartment with a roommate- that's issue number 1. I already know that an electronic kit would be the quietest option, as well as take up less space than my acoustic kit. But, issue number 2, I already own an acoustic kit and would just need to bring it from my mom's (four hours away) and get mesh heads/cymbal mutes. The problem is that my kit is pretty old and a few other things need to be replaced on it, and I'm really not sure if it will be quiet enough even with mesh heads and mutes. 

I am in college so I don't have a large amount of money to spend, and I'm trying to weight my options. I know it might be cheaper to rebuild my kit, but maybe not the best option right now. I don't have the money for a super nice electronic kit, so I also worry that buying a cheaper kit would be a bad investment (the first electronic one I had I got too fast for haha.)

While I understand the theory of it has anyone got any ideas about how I can more really get into how a drummer thinks about and writes about music, I watched a couple videos about how to write drums and the understanding of rhythm these drummers has was amazing, nothing like anything I'm used to.

16,DRUM,Trouble tuning snare,"I pierced my top skin so I got a new one. I was in the process of tuning it when I noticed a ring when I hit the drum. I was trying to figure out what happened so I flipped over the drum and found a crack in the bottom skin. I got that replaced too. But I‚Äôm still hearing a ring. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done so far:

- Made sure the bottom skin was tight and all the lungs were even
- Made sure the top skin sounded half as deep as the bottom skin and that all the lungs were even
- Made sure snare wires were in center of bottom skin

After all that I‚Äôm still getting a ring. Also I‚Äôm having trouble tuning the snare wires, I don‚Äôt know how tight I should be making them.

I‚Äôm aiming to get the snap I got on my old snare head, I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point.

I‚Äôm also a bit embarrassed because I‚Äôve been drumming for 6+ years and I‚Äôm only finish out now that you‚Äôre supposed to change the skins every 6 months. I‚Äôve only changed out my bass and now this because they broke. And for the first 3 years of my drumming career I was on a snare pad and electric kit.

Ok so how do I get rid of the ringing and properly tune my snare wires?",1567567145

I'm skeptical about buying the OffSet brand because I don't wanna spend $450 on pedals I can't try out first. Also, I've read complaints about the beaters and the response. If I'm wrong about my skepticism, please let me know. I'm still opening to buying them.

I've always been using an iron cobra pedal that doesn't specify which model it is, but judging by newer models this is an old version of the hp900. Since I am not sure if I really want to stick to double bass pedals (and that the double version of the 900 is like 450 euro, lol) I started looking for pedals under 275 euro, and stumbled on the Mapex P800TW. I don't know much about pedals, but from what I've tried so far I really do prefer a double chain, and other than that I'm clueless. I don't play in a band where I need to be able to use 2 pedals, it's more of like a fun thing, being able to play heavier songs at home. Any clue if this would be a good option? I have no clue if this iron cobra is up to modern standards so I really don't know what to expect. Thanks!",1565794609

62,DRUM,New Type of Drumstick,"Hello All,

I have a new type of drumstick. ¬†It is a new option to the well known Bundle Sticks/Multi Rods.

These sticks allow you to play the drums at a lower volume, actually 20 decibels less than regular sticks. ¬†This means that regular sticks sound 4 times louder than these.

They are a solid stick, so they feel like a normal drumstick, no energy loss from small dowel rods spreading out. ¬†They do not chip and fall apart.

They have the same clear attack on the drums and cymbals like regular sticks. ¬†

I am seeking interest in these sticks. ¬†They are patent-pending and will be released on Kickstarter soon.

If you would like to be notified on the release of them, and to learn more about them, please message me with your email address and I will send you the kickstarter link before the release. ¬†¬†

Please also post here if you are interested, and any thoughts.

Thanks dudes!

6,DRUM,[Advice] Need recommendations on drum cases for long term storage,"Hi r/DRUM,

I'm leaving my studio behind and need a place to store my drums.  It will be stored in a connex outside (not temperature controlled).  I have a 2005 5-piece Tama Starclassic Maple (8x10, 9x12, 13x15 toms, 17x22 kick, and 5.5x13 snare) and I'd obviously like to keep it in the best condition possible.  My place is small and my family's growing, so drumming is low on the priority list.

I have gig bags, but I'm not confident they'll provide enough protection.  Drum cases are obviously expensive, and I'm willing to shell out because in a few months time they'll pay for themselves with what I would have been paying in studio rent, anyways.  So my question: what should I be looking for?  I imagine a foam-lined, hard shell exterior is the win...if they can survive being dropped from the top of a shelf without much worry, that'd be ideal.  Also, my drums aren't  standard dimensions.  I have a SKB container for my hardware that I'm generally happy with.  Any advice on what brand?  Any idea of a realistic amount of money I'll be spending?

51,DRUM,Ludwig Acro restoration suggestions?,"Friends, I acquired a 60s Ludwig Acro a while back and finally got around to restoring it. Couple issues with the restoration however.
1. The throw does not hold the snare straps in place. I just pierced the nylon snare straps with the screws on the throw so they stay in place. Any more professional ideas to fix it would be appreciated. 
2. Internal Muffler was missing when I got the drum, so I need to replace it. Wondering what would be a good period correct muffler to mount in it. 
3. Chrome on the lugs is worn, chipped, and pitted. I've done similar work on a CB kit with some good ol WD40, but I feel like it won't fix the chipped chrome.
4. She'll is beat up quite a bit with some deep scratches.

Most drummers know that 3rd party bass drum triggering appears to be on the rise at the moment.

I've managed to disassemble almost all of it and just haven't finished bc he lost the dismount key. Before I buy any key online, a few questions:

1. Will any standard tuning key fit and be enough to mount/dismount the drums? I found some -- Liverpool, Torelli -- but wasn't whether a ""tuning key"" was also ok to unscrew parts off of an electronic drum.
2. Any warning signs I should look out for? I was just gonna buy some inexpensive key bc this drum set is not so young and sought out anymore, but avoiding any knowingly shitty piece could help

12,DRUM,Retraining feet/ankles/legs after major reconstructive surgeries,"Ok, so this is a bit of a long story but here goes nothing;
I am a 25 year old that has been drumming for about 12 years now. I had very few lessons to start with, and I was lucky enough to be kind of a natural in music. I self taught myself and worked hard just learning covers of songs and practicing techniques I saw on youtube videos. I'd like to say I'm pretty good, or at least was.
I was born with extremely flat feet which have always had a negative impact on my physical abilities, and shoes are about the most stressful purchase I have to make. In 2010 I sprained an ankle while on a 32 mile backpacking excursion with outward bound, and shortly after going to the doctor, I was told that I have arthritis in all of my lower joints, and that If I didn't have surgery to correct my pronation (my feet/ankles bow inwards) that I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 40. The solution was to have a calchanial osteotomy (and a few other minor pins and bone extensions that I can't remember the names of) in both of my feet. Each surgery was excruciating and the first one nearly killed me after they over drugged the shit out of me. It took me 4 years to have both surgeries with about 9 weeks non weight bearing each time. My calfs would shrivel up and I loss all the muscle I had there, but over time recovered it. I never did do physical therapy and as a result I don't have great flexibility in my feet which has severely affected my drumming.
I have always primarily played heels up, but when playing slower beats I find that I have so little flexibility, I cannot play anything faster than a 16th note beat without using so much of my legs that my endurance runs out after about 20 seconds. It's frustrating because before my surgeries I always took pride and got compliments for my kick technique. I could play hard songs like ""my hero"" and easily keep up with the insane kick pattern. Now I can't even get past the intro. I've tried playing heels down or even heel toe, but those are even worse as they require more flexibility than my feet have to offer. I'm looking into getting Physical therapy, but I'm worried because it was 2015 when I had my last surgery, and I've lived a fairly sedentary lifestyle (outside of work). It's been so discouraging that I haven't hardly played like I used to before and I get so frustrated that my progress now isn't as fast or effective. 
I'm curious if any of you have suggestions that could help me? I'd love to hear from someone who has had major foot surgery and what you had to do to get your endurance and ability back. If anyone has videos or any kind of suggestions please do let me know! Much love!",1546749837
13,DRUM,How to achieve a R&amp;B/Soul drum tone,"I‚Äôve been listening to Anderson .Paak, Thundercat, The Internet, etc. and between all the electronic drum samples, there‚Äôs a fair amount of real drums being played.  I want to get my drums to sound like the tone from Childish Gambino‚Äôs ‚ÄúAwaken, My Love!‚Äù  album, a good example of this is the song ‚ÄúHave Some Love‚Äù, which starts off with the drum groove, as well as ‚ÄúThem Changes‚Äù by Thundercat.  There‚Äôs a fair amount of Tom drum fills in Gambino‚Äôs song ‚ÄúBoogieman‚Äù that outlines the rack/floor Tom sound I‚Äôm going for.

I used to play my brother‚Äôs drums while he lived at home, but recently they have been taken down and he‚Äôs about to move them into his new home, so I‚Äôm looking to build a (hopefully decently cheap) drum kit of my own based on things that I want/like as opposed to what he had. His kit was a very nice DW collector‚Äôs series, but unfortunately, he always bought the shittiest cymbals that are now almost completely destroyed, and rarely kept up maintenance on the kit. He also played basically strictly rock and metal music so he had a big metal snare drum with a horrendous snap to it, and he had a load of toms from high to low that had a decent amount of ring to it. (Which I don‚Äôt want)

My question I guess is, when going about building a kit, with these sounds I want in mind, what do I need to accomplish this as far as:
Drum type (size of the drum, type of wood, type of brand, type of price bracket if it truly reflects in the quality of the drum)
Cymbal type (size of the cymbal, type of brand, also specific series)
Mechanics (what kind of drum heads, how the drums should be tuned, if I need dampening gel, etc.)
And last but not least if you know anything about the post production side at all. (Any EQ moves or compression techniques that are used in the recordings I‚Äôve listed, since my endgame is to record)
I‚Äôm hoping that if I can understand the mechanics of drums a little better, I won‚Äôt have to spend a great deal of money and still get a sound that I can be pleased with.

A while back I really wanted to learn how to drum - and I still do - but haven't been able to find a space to practice at. I was given a drum set free of charge and now that I am facing some financial issues that drum set is looking quite ripe for the selling. I'm just having trouble figuring out the value because the skin on the bass drum is ruptured and taped over and there are some noticeable signs of wear and tear. The drum set is Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl with blue/olive badges and the serial number indicates it's circa 1970-76 (926176). I only have one bass, one rack tom, and a floor tom. Other than that I have a nondescript snare drum, a kick pedal, and a medley of cymbals. I am not a drum expert AT ALL and I just wanted some input so I don't go into the selling process looking like a dunce and possibly losing money. Pics below and thank you kindly for your help.

My question is, why did they bother setting up his kit for that one song if he knew he wasn't going to use most of it? Is there something about how big-name bands load in that makes it easier to just set up the whole kit rather than just what you would be using for the one song?",1545940360

I've drummed for a couple of years, casually, but recently I've started becoming more motivated to start drumming the fast and good stuff.
For most this doesn't sound all that good, but I've drummed System of a down - Holy Mountains and Toxicity. These 2 before I started with them in my lessons were way above my level, but now I play them with ease. I learned toxicity in less than a week at full speed, and now I'm looking for something new and exciting to step up my game.

The song needs to be quick, yet still have instinctive ways of playing (e.g the fills in toxicity were fast, but after repeating them a couple times they felt very smooth to play).

Recently I've been listening more to rock (and some metal). A couple songs I like to listen to are very cool to play, but usually require double bass. If someone has a way to replace double basses that'd be amazing. One of those songs is Mortal Reminder by Pentakill.

Does anyone have any suggestions? ^_^",1529274038

The crash i got with it is a 17"" Meinl Raker Crash, and the hihat is a Meinl Raker 14"" hihat. 

Sadly though, i feel the crash is way outta place, and cannot get it to fit into my drumming at all, especially if i hit it continously.

But if im correct, i read that i should get a ride insted? for continous hitting? 

Any tips on what to get to complete my setup?",1515538854

I'm fairly happy with it as far as convenience goes, but I'm finding it difficult to get a sound I like out of the converted tom. It's either too resonant with a long decay that sounds way too boomy, or super short and papery if I loosen either head too much. I'd like to be able to record some demos/ideas with this kit until I can get back to my full-size Catalina, but so far the recorded sounds have been super disappointing. I've found countless videos and articles describing the different methods of turning a floor tom into a kick, but never any advice on the best way to go about actually tuning the tom to get a decent ""kick"" sound out of it. 

Full disclosure, it's a no-name tom made from some gray composite material. No badges or any kind of identifying marks on it, but I've read over and over that ""crappy"" drums can be tuned to sound at least decent. Maybe it just doesn't translate over when converting into a kick, though...Any help you guys can offer would be super appreciated. ",1510677486

- 8"", 10"", 12"", 14"", 16"" 18"" toms.
- Two 22 x 18 bass drums
- 14 x 5.5 snare
- 16"", 17"" and 18"" Sabian stage crashes
- 14"" Sabian Stage hi-hat
- Two Paiste Alpha Metal ride cymbals
- 10"" Alpha Metal splash cymbal
- and a 19"" Sabian holy china.

- All heads are Evans EC2/Emads 2, with the snare Evans ST Dry.

My ideal sound is that powerful clean recording that you get from power metal drums. However, I feel confident in the heads, drums and cymbals that I use but bass drums are a little difficult to pick. I can't decide if I should add holes into my bass drums or not, and if so, should it be kickports or regular ring holes? Should they be 4"" or 6"" holes etc. I have a lot of questions that only chain react to another. 

So do you any of you guys have any experience on this type of sound? Which will bring the best results? Granted this is specifically for home recording, so nothing that will be great for live or anything like that.",1509318049

Landlord's late son played drums back in the day.  As a drummer, I was tasked with figuring out about how much his drums cost, or what my landlord could earn from it.  I took some pictures, so I can provide them if necessary, but a cursory look at it suggests it's not a very valuable drum kit (Mapex Mars Pro Series, made in Taiwan).  I wanna say they got it in the early 90s, possibly the late 80s.  Aside from being dusty, seems like it's in good condition, but based off some general features (and not knowing the wood), I'd say my old Tama Rockstar was a better kit (esp. considering the star-cast mounting system).

Can anyone point me in the right direction for this research?  Or does anybody have a Mapex (or a wealth of knowledge on the drumline)?

[This song](https://youtu.be/y7JMwaBlWxs) has a very similar drum pattern to what I think I want, but I have no idea how to notate it or how to describe it (other than clapping it out, I guess, but I'd like to learn the language of drummers, y'know?). I'm not asking for a transcription, but rather a description of what the drummer is doing--what are they hitting? How often?

5,DRUM,How frequently do you tune your snare? Which lug will you have to tune up?,"I am just realising how quickly, only one lug of my snare gets untuned.  I will play for 1h30, and I already have to tune that one lug up again.  And that lug is way lower than all the others, by almost one complete turn.

At first, I thought the threads were just torn off.  Then, I tried to rotate my snare on its stand to verify if it was really the threads or rather if it was the position of the lug itself (relative to where I hit the skin).  It turns out that lug stay tuned, but another one got untuned, at the same position as the previous one was before.  So I concluded that the lug that is right in front of me, the closest to me, is getting untuned really quickly, and all of the others are almost always correct.

I want to know more about this, so I have 2 questions:

1- How frequently do you tune your snare?  Does 1h30 of play time seems not very long to you too?

2- When you tune it, is there a specific lug that always gets untuned compared to others?

I've tried searching for some sort of advice but keep getting results for open-handed vs cross-stick.

9,DRUM,Electronic Drum Kit Suggestions,"While I'm sure you guys see this question relatively regularly, I couldn't find much recently in a search.   I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for electronic kits?  I played (acoustic) for a few years in high school, so I'm not necessarily a beginner (though is has been like... 8 years?).  More importantly, I've been living in apartments ever since, so acoustic is more-or-less out of the picture.

Key points: I'm not *really* a beginner, but it *has* been awhile.  Money isn't really an issue (EDIT: Okay, it's *sort of* an issue.  Maybe not too far above $2k at a max?).  My favorite genres tend to be classic rock and some funkier stuff.

Are there any brands I should be gravitating towards or avoiding?  Are there certain technologies that are a giveaway for poor quality/obviously a shortcut?  Any tips at all, really, for the electronic-kit-search?",1486514074

22,DRUM,Small town band - Massive opportunity,"Hey guys. I hope you're all well.

I'm a drummer in a retro-rock band named Grusom from Denmark. You're welcome to check us out on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSzdBlvnURA
We released a full album last summer on both LP, CD and streamning. The full album is also on Youtube. I really hope that you like the music, and another album is on the way.

We are 6 guys from the same town who just loves playing music and try to see where it takes us. So far we've had very positive responses from various parts around the world, which is amazing! And last year we got an award for ""Best Danish Rock Release"" alongside playing at Copenhell (probably the biggest metal festival in the country). Something none of us had foreseen nor expected. 

We have indeed been taken by surprise about how positively our band has been received - But it doesn't stop here. Just a few days ago we were chosen along with 9 other Danish bands, to have a chance to support none other than Metallica for 1 of 4 shows! This is HUGE for us.
It's happening over a poll on Metallicas own website. https://metallica.com/blog/news/437382/you-pick-the-opening-acts-in-copenhagen

We could really use some help to achieve possibly the biggest opportunity and experience we might ever get.
So if you enjoy our music (and please feel free to listen and checks us out on Youtube and/or Facebook https://www.facebook.com/grusomband/
We would greatly appreciate some help on the poll &lt;3 It would be so amazing for some small town guys to go in stage to support such a large international band as Metallica.

I sincerely hope this doesn't contradict the policy of this subreddit, however you're still very welcome to check us and our music out!

Love, the drummer",1484673131

I recently realized that I can play, sing, and use my feet to keep a beat (after some practice of course). So my idea was to get 2 drum pedals and use my guitar case for a stand in kick drum and use something higher pitched (snare maybe?) for my other foot, but I don't know what to use. 

Is the guitar case a bad idea? Is there a better option for cheap? I'm not trying to sell out Madison Square Garden, just trying to be excited about playing again by trying something new. So here is the big question: **Would anyone have any advice for a person who can only use his feet and doesn't want to break his wallet doing that? I am willing to spend $100-150**

45,DRUM,Am I making the right decision?,"Hi everyone,

I hope y'all can help me make the right decision on this topic.

Background: I'm pursuing an artistic vision, which could maybe be summarized as ""RATM of the 21th Century"". I play the guitars, bass, and occasional keyboard myself, aswell as the rapping. As of now, the drums have always been made using a drum machine. The biggest problem with this approach isn't the drum machine itself, but rather the fact that I am not a drummer, and therefore simply do not know how good fills and breaks are constructed.

In order to remedy this situation, I'm playing with the thought of getting an E-Drum and learning the trade. The stylistic focus would be on HipHop HiHat patterns, aswell as Metal doublebass drumming. It would need to be an E-Drum due to the noise levels.

My first question is, am I on the right track?

The second question would be what kind of equipment you guys would recommend. I'm currently entertaining the thought of a Millenium MPS-750 or maybe an Alesis DM10, with a separately purchased doublebass pedal like a Tama Speedcobra HP310LW.

As a sidenote, I'd like to get first-hand hardware, and stay below 1k‚Ç¨. Thank you very much for your valued input.

55,DRUM,Advice on a drum pad.,"Hi guys, first time posting here so bear with me.
I'm looking to get an electronic drum pad so I can jam around the house, but need some help deciding on one.
I used to have a small drum set back at my parents house, but now that I'm moved into an apartment, that isn't really an option. I don't play drums professionally or anything, I just want something relatively quiet that I can plug in my headphones and jam along to some songs.
I found this pad so far:
http://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/DD-65-Digital-Drums.gc
I like how portable it is and that I can stow it away easily, and can pull it out onto a table when I want to use it.

-I've seen some others with 5 pads but I feel that's too few, especially for cymbals. The configuration on a 5-pad also seems a little weird, especially for the snare/hi-hat. What do you guys think on this?
- How do the cymbal pads work? It seems you can only hit it on the top, and since it's one pad, you can't hit it in different spots for different sounds?
-Do these pads usually come with a stand, or have something on the bottom to easily attach one? I feel like that would be better than setting it on a table.
-An option for double bass would be a huge plus, as the metal music I listen to uses a lot of that. 4 cymbals would also be a huge plus; hi-hat, crash, ride, and a splash. I have a double bass pedal already, so a setup that I can use the pedals I already have would be huge.

Any recommendations on a nice pad would be great, thanks guys!",1480239984

78,DRUM,Miking Bass Drum Help,"Hi everyone,
I've done a lot of searching around online and here on Reddit and I can't find an answer to my question. I'm playing a gig Friday night and the kit has no hole in the resonant head. We don't have a little stand to put the mike in front of the drum and I really would prefer not to cut a hole in the front in case I need it as a desperation spare mid-gig/because it's not my kit!
I was wondering whether it was OK to loosen a few of the 'screws' (I don't know the proper name I'm afraid) on the bass drum, slip the microphone in, then tighten them, but not so much as to crush the wire. Would this be OK? Has anyone done this themselves? 
I've got a distant memory of doing it this way at a gig in the past. I'm more worried about damaging the head somehow.
I would appreciate any advice, as I'm pretty new to miking up drums.

79,DRUM,Requesting suggestions on some changes to my kit,"Long story short, I am just getting back into playing my kit after some years. I was never very serious about playing, but I do love to play casually with music or with my friends every other day or so. I currently have a Ddrum Diablo 5-piece set with clear Remo pinstripe heads. My music tastes have changed over the years (from heavy rock to more jazz/electic-alternative rock) and my play style has along with it. Here are the changes I'd like to make and would truly appreciate feedback on:

- I want to have a 4-peice kit. I don't have the funds for this currently, so I was thinking of removing my highest tom and placing the second tom in its place. Would this just be silly? 

- I need desperately new drum heads. I'm looking for a head that will give me a very full sound but still be relatively quiet (for a drum, that is). I play in a rather close-quarters neighborhood, and if I jam at 100% it is obnoxiously loud to not only me but my neighbors as well. So, something that you'd bring to an acoustic set. I recently went to my local music store and almost every head was Evans Level 360. is this just a new name for Evans? or is it a specific head? I have been reading about the Evans Heavyweight, also, but I'm not sure if it's what I'm looking for.

- I'd love to get new sticks that would assist with keeping the noise level lower, and I have seen a pair, VicFirth Rute 505, that I think would do the job. Any other suggestions?

In the future, I'd love to get my hands on a new ride, as my current Sabian B8 20"" ride is too thick and overpowering for my tastes. 

Thank you very much for reading through this, and any knowledge or suggestions you can pass on are appreciated!",1456864503

86,DRUM,Practice Tips,"Do you have any helpful practice tips? Share them below. Here are a few of mine:


Practice slowly in the beginning so that you will make as few mistakes as possible. This way you are programming your brain to play it correctly right from the beginning. 

If you are about to make a mistake, slow down immediately (think of going slow mo) and work through the problem area without stopping. 
Return to problem areas and work through them slowly. Loop the bar(s) that are giving you trouble. 

Always try to make what you‚Äôre practicing as musical as possible. Instead of just hammering out the notes blindly, think of what musical situation you might use the exercise in. Then play the exercise with the phrasing, dynamics etc. of that style. For example, if you‚Äôre practicing rock grooves, think of how your favourite rock drummer would play that exercise. Then try to reproduce that sound on your instrument. If you‚Äôre practicing rudiments, imagine how a drumline would play a 5-stroke roll or a paradiddle and let that influence how you play yours. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with a particular style, do some research! 

How you practice something is how you will perform it! Make sure that you practice whatever you‚Äôre working on correctly and with the proper feel. That way, when you go to perform you‚Äôll sound your best!

5,DRUM,Gear Help (back pain due to terribly made drumkit),"I'm looking for good, price efficient drums and drum hardware. I currently have a Fender Starcaster kit with a bass drum, 11 inch, 12 inch, and 16 inch tom, a Ludwig Blackrolite, a Tama Speedcobra, 13 inch Meinl HCS hats, 20 inch sabian B8 ride.  
The toms suck, snare is great (bought separately) and so is the bass drum (relatively, that is. I could easily record with this kit and it wouldn't be a problem, but it sounds so mediocre and stale to me at this point that it isn't fun to play sometimes). 13 inch hats are the bane of my existence and they clash with the rest of the kit, especially the ride cymbal, the ride cymbal isn't bad but it's a very specific and situational cymbal.  
Now you know the situation, here's what I'm looking for 1. best value for the money, 2. things that work and are reliable.  
Here's a fat list of what I need hardware wise (really could use some good deals on these, it's not drums themselves that break the bank, but all the extras and cymbals which kill your wallet): boom arm cymbal stand, drum throne, two bass drum beaters with better attack than speedcobra beaters, crash cymbal stand (might just get tama roadpro for extra boomarm just in case), something that can be used to clip tom-toms onto cymbal stands, and a splash cymbal stand/holder.  

Drum and music wise: I'm looking for maple drums, I don't necessarily need a new bass drum at the moment, but I'll take kit/BD recommendations for a 20/22 inch. I play a lot of varied styles, I want a floor tom on both sides of me to get that ""wardrum"" kind of effect you hear in doom metal a lot, then for when I play black metal/psychedelic rock it'd be nice to have toms that sound good with roll fills, and in general honestly. Probably 10 inch, and 12/14 inch, then I can put my bad ones somewhere around the kit to be used every now and then. Looking for a splash cymbal, thinking wuhan 10 inch splash cause it's cheap yet sounds good.  

TL;DR: The issue isn't necessarily money, I can save up obviously (already doing that for cymbals, meinl byzance darks) but when I play the drum kit it's really uncomfortable and gives me back pain due to the toms and ride cymbal being placed so oddly (ride is on a stock straight stand that's far too high, good stand nonetheless). If I can get some cheaper stuff now that would save my back in 10 years. Priority is drum throne, boom stand, two maple toms, and a tom rack or tom clips. Eventually I want to have four toms sitting in front of me if that helps make it easier to determine what would be best for me. There's just so much gear out there it's a ridiculous information black hole and I'm weary to delve into it, took me over a year to determine what cymbals I wanted.",1453368879

I heard everything : from ""it's pure shit"" to ""it's great! Just buy one"".
Thing is i will never be able to have a real drum set in my house. Never. 
I'm just a real beginner (must have played 40 hours in my life) and I think an electronic kit would be alright for now. At least for fun.

I'm searching for something from 400 to 600e. Preferably something without the iphone/ipad friendly apps, as I don't have any iphone. 

I want to play rock songs mostly, like everybody else. Weird sounds and everything are cool but not a must have. Don't need an amp.

I have to say I already tried one, i'm ok with the different feeling and all, my main concern is that i want the kit to ""feel"" everything I hit, and not just when i hit with strength. On the other side, i'm not playing ghost note. Not my level yet. 

Any recommendations for I start searching? Thank you

Would the response from the mesh pad be better than the response of the Simmons pad or is that a factor of the brain? Further, if I play really fast on the Simmons, it will miss a few hits here and there. Would this be solved by a better pad or, again, is that the brain?

My high school was rather small, and I was one of two snares all three years. We played with matched grip, so I never developed a traditional.

54,DRUM,"Drummers- pay careful attention to your computer workspaces; over time, poor ergonomic practices can hamper your ability to play.","Since I've recently relocated from San Diego to Seattle I find myself on the computer far more than I was when I was in my old location; currently I'm dealing with a bout of tendinitis in my left arm; the top/bottom of it feels like it's on fire when I lift something. 

The ironic thing is, since I play traditional grip that's not been affected because instead of an up/down wrist movement it's more of a rotational thing which absolves me of any sort of pain when I play. 

I've narrowed it to my laptop (Macbook Pro); when I'm typing, the lower right corner of my palm rests upon the corner of the housing, putting a slight pressure onto the nerve and that gets sent upstream to my elbow. 

Last year I had a similar thing befall me; my desk was too high and when I'd sit my wrists were bent downwards, as my hands were slightly higher and that caused the top of my right arm to completely lose feeling. Acupuncture was the only thing that saved me while the nerve healed after I identified the problem.

I have been watching drum cover since and stumbled upon this sub while browns sets on guitar center. I have a few questions I was hoping someone could help me with:

-Going from guitar, how different is the musical experience (beside the obvious) such as developing rhythm and muscle memory?

-How do you learn drums? there are million of step by step guitar lesson on youtube is extremely easy to find anything. I would consider it a lot harder to learn the drums especially since you can't just look up tabs (maybe you can, I'm a noob),

-What would be a good kit for a beginner? I'm 19 so a litter older that usual. Is there a major advantage to electronic drums or are acoustic the way to go? loudness is not a major concern.

-best way to get started and any advice?

I realize this is an extremely novice post, however, I literally cannot get drumming off my mind, super weird.

But I don't know where I can find decent drum fills or even just interesting beats and grooves to play. Is there any free site where I can get some good sounding sheet music?
Or any other suggestions like buying books ect
I have tried watching people on youtube and other sites, but they play to quick to see whats going on and they're camera angles are incredibly bad. 

Please can anyone suggest a good site with good sheet music. Any style will do Jazz, Rock, Blues I'm interested in it all.
or even other suggestions

11,DRUM,Silent Stroke kit noise vs E-kit noise,"A few months ago I purchased a Yamaha DTX-532k. Having played it on and off during this time I'm quite happy to say that I like playing and haven't lost interest and want to up my game.

There are a few issues I have with it, which are mostly noise related. The weight of the hi hat and the physical striking of it is rather unpleasant outside of the headphone environment and it wobbles all over the place. Granted, some of this could be down to the low end stand (bundled Yamaha) but I think it's a combination of the two. The cymbals also generate an obvious whack. I had already stopped using the KP65 kick tower due to the noise from that and ""downgraded"" to the KU100 pedal which is an improvement in noise but still bangs on the floor.

The floor of the room the kit was in wasn't ideal but it hasn't caused huge problems. This weekend I was able to move it into a different room with my guitar stuff. Although there is more space and the kit is more suited to that room physically it projects a lot more noise through the floor than it seemed to before. There are things to try to deal with that but I've been eyeing up acoustic kits for a while (as of now I haven't used one).

Between Silent Stroke and Gen16/the upcoming L80's (or even regular cymbals with various mute types) it seems feasible I could replace the kit with an acoustic kit. However as much as all the videos, and posts all over the web seem to discuss the effect that has on the volume of the drums, I haven't seen anything mentioning or comparing the vibrations/environment noise with an e-kit. 

tldr; Can anyone offer any view or comparison between a silenced acoustic kit (mesh heads and low volume/muted cymbals) and a e-kit with regards to floor noise and vibration. ",1439759872

17,DRUM,Do-It-Yourself E-Drum [DIY],"Hi everybody!
This is my first post here in /r/drum, so first of all i'd like to greet everyone here!

Long story short.

I used to play drums, but then had to stop for some years. Now I would really like to play them again, but in order to do that, I do need an e-drum(noise reasons). I do not have money to spend on a serious e-drum kit, nor I actually want it, because I love the feeling that an acoustic drum gives. I still have my pretty old&amp;bad acoustic set(Tama Swingstar), and I don't want to lose it, so I would like to transform it into an e-drum, which actually means triggering and using mesh heads in order to reduce volume.

Now, I know I can just buy triggers, but I actually love DIYing stuff, so I would like to do that by myself. I have some electronics knowledge so I think I may be able to do it.

Does anyone of you ever made something like that? How did you do? There are a number of tutorial out there in the net, but I was not able to find one that was a complete and well-done walkthrough guide from building triggers to how connecting them to a pc. What tutorial did you follow, if you did?


Last thing, I think that it would be cool to group all of drum-related DIY projects somehow. What do you think?

However, as my drumming has progressed, and I've aquired some AA splashes and so forth, my B8's are having a harder time keeping up soundwise. But, I also would like to add some character to my kit. Here's some of the options I've been considering:

UFiP: Tiger Series - http://en.ufip.it/tiger-series
Soultone: Extreme Series - http://www.soultonecymbals.com/content/extreme-series-0

I've also heard good things about Sabian AA's- comments?

In total, I'm looking to replace 2 crashes, a set of hats, and a ride. If you guys have any suggestions and comments, I'd love to hear them and it'd be greatly appreciated! I'm willing to spend money for quality, but I'm not gonna drop 800 bucks for the greatest crash in the world. My plan right now is to replace the cymbals one by one, maybe mix-and-match different sets and styles- would you recommend this?

Thanks for subscribing and helping us reach **400 subscribers**! As many of you know the hardest part of growing a subreddit is getting the ball rolling and to show our appreciation us mods are going to give away THREE pairs of drumsticks OF YOUR CHOICE to one lucky winner!

**To get one entry into the draw:** You must post a comment in this thread with a picture of your drumset (including verification please) and write a short paragraph telling us why you got into drums and what kind of music you enjoy playing!

**BONUS ENTRY:** Do you REALLY need some new sticks? You can earn one additional entry into the draw by composing and performing a 16 measure rudimental snare solo. The solo must contain at least one of each type of rudiment (roll, diddle, flam, drag) and be of a moderate tempo (any attempts to cheat by performing an obviously slow &amp;amp; simple solo will result in full disqualification). The solo must be performed on video and shared in your original entry comment along with the transcription for your solo for everyone to see.

Entries are closed at midnight on Feb 14th or once we hit 450 subscribers, whichever comes first. We will draw the winner at random and contact them privately to find out their preferred stick and shipping address.

Notes:

Limit one entry per user (plus bonus entry). All accounts must be at least 1 month old and have a posting history (no account duping for additional entry). If one of the mods discovers foul play you will be immediately disqualified.

Drumsticks must of standard value ($12.50 each), totaling no more than $40. In other words, no, we aren't going to give you 3 pairs of Vic Firth Titans or any other specialty stick. If you are predominantly a percussionist and would prefer to receive a set of mallets instead, we will accommodate that within reason.

Thanks for subbing and good luck everybody! We sincerely thank you for your support!

**EDIT:** Due to the low number of entries we'll be changing the rules a bit. Each entry will receive one pair of sticks, and the double entry with the snare solo will receive two pairs. Messages will be sent to the participants shortly. ",1422826064

11,DRUM,Sloppy drummer here - When I play fills I play my toms in 'reverse' order...??,"Hi /r/drum; dirty guitarist scum here. 

I've been playing guitar since I was about 9 and drums (to a lesser extent) since I was about 13. I'm now 29. I've had two acoustic kits in this time and now practise on a Roland TD-8KV electronic kit.

I used to kid myself that I just did drums 'on the side' as a fun hobby/distraction from guitars, but nowadays I think I have to start to admit that I really enjoy drumming (I've played in bands and at church etc) and I'd really like to get better. 

I've always approached my drumming from a 'Ringo' perspective, that is to say that I think I have a good 'groove' and can play many styles but I have no 'technique' to speak of. Every fill I play is different and pretty much improvised in the moment, which means that sometimes I 'overstretch' my abilities and can't always pull off the fill I hear in my head. Also if I can't quite nail a pattern of a song I know I often just substitute certain parts so it's easier for me to play (I think a lot of drummers probably do this starting off..??). I think it's important to have a good grasp of the basics rather than trying to learn to do massive huge fills etc....

To this end I've started learning about 'rudiments' etc and trying to learn some 'technique' rather than just making random hits somehow 'work' in the context of whatever song I'm playing, but one example of my sloppy 'DIY' style is that often when I play fills with multiple tom hits, I seem to play the toms in 'reverse' order, i.e. from lowest pitch to highest, so that I can be ready to go back into the next bit of the groove with a crash hit with my right hand (I'm right-handed).

Is this a common occurrence with drummers? Is it 'wrong'? Or does it just sound sloppy?? In my head it sounds like it should go down the pitch of the toms (rack to mid to floor for example...).

What do people think? If it's a common issue, is there a good technique to 'un-learn' it??",1406746125
12,DRUM,I gained ownership of the sub! What's the next step?,"Hey guys!

I gained ownership of the subreddit by requesting it on /r/redditrequest which is great news, because the previous owner was deleted. However, I don't think I have the experience or knowledge to be the owner (although I'm fine with modding as long as everyone's cool with it). So, is anyone interested in being mod (preferable with some experience)? 

Also, here are some basic rule ideas, let me know what you think. The allowed link idea will be discussed. The big question is: Should we allow pictures of kits, or leave that to /r/drums? 

* No racism or any other type of discrimination.
* No circlejerking (We can elaborate on this).
* Respect the staff.
* Only used approved links/websites (We can discuss the links and maybe filter out some bad ones).
* No nudity, porn, or gore.
* Tag your posts (This way we can have it so people can filter out pictures of set ups if they don't want to see it and such).

EDIT: 

I posted over at /r/drums to see if anyone is still interested, hopefully we can bring in some new people and find some mods. Discuss here what you would like to see for this sub. What do you guys think about disallowing pictures but having a weekly gear thread like /r/bass does? 

EDIT 2:

Topic points (We'll probably make separate posts for these in the future):

* Flair (What do you want to see?)

* Crossovers/collabs with /r/wearethemusicmakers and /r/bass

* Tags (What tags should we use?) &lt;- Being worked on

* Resources/Wiki (Have any resources or want to write stuff for the wiki?)

* Subreddit style (What pictures should we use? Colors?) &lt;- Being worked on

I constantly see listings for ""cymbils"", ""cymbols"", ""cymbles"" but most often it is ""symbols"". The thing that makes it so funny to me is the same idiot selling his ""symbols"" actually manages to spell Zildjian correctly. It makes me chuckle.
