**...created, obtained, defended...‚Ä¢Ukraine 2014-2022. Always remembered.**

**‚Ä¢**

**I'm 16 years old, I'm from Ukraine. I play the piano, write my own music and draw paintings.**

**I am looking for a creative educational institution in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the USA or any another country with English as the language of instruction.**

**I want to tell you more about myself so that you have a better idea of me and can advise more precisely which institution can suit me:**

**I started drawing at the age of 9 without any training. My works were inspired by images of my childhood. In my works, each of the viewers feels something personal. My chosen medium, subject, style, are currently best suited to expressing the images in which I perceive my inner world. More than 30 of these works were included in my first album ""Images from childhood"":**

**I started writing music at the age of 13 after one year of piano lessons. I combined my music with painting, feeling a certain connection between sounds and color. 10 works from this series were included in my second album ""Colors and sounds"":**

**Recently, I became interested in studying computer graphics, animation and creating synthetic music. I really want to work in these areas, because with their help I will gain new skills in which I will show my creative thinking to create more grandiose things.**

**In my development, I value creativity the most, so it would be very good if I could realize all these hobbies in one institution.**

**In parallel with high school, I studied at the music school with a degree in piano and graduated from the first year of music college with a degree in music theory. I am currently finishing the 12th grade of high school and the last(8) grade of music school, in May I will receive a high school diploma and a certificate of graduation from music school.**

**At the moment there is a war in Ukraine, due to difficult circumstances I am not able to pay for education, so it would be great if I received support during my studies. I can consider combining study with work.**

Do you learn a song, then move on to another and practise the first a little bit each time you sit down or something as now I am playing the same thing over and over I start to lose interest.

24,piano,Need some help regarding books having theory and also guide as to how should one play with 2 hands.,"So, hey everyone! Let me tell you something about myself. I am currently 18 years old and having my exams the next Monday yet here I am posting on reddit. Let's come to the point. I started playing keyboard when I was 10 years old learnt for some 3 years then left it mid way. But one fine day me and my father was watching TV and suddenly an ad appeared and after few minutes I was able to play the exact tuning on the keyboard. My father was shocked so he got me to an Institute and my journey with keyboard resumed. But the thing is in that Institute the teacher used to teach us songs by giving away the notes. After 1 year I was experienced enough to listen to any song and replicate it on the keyboard, so he started to give me songs on the spot thenceforth. 

I stopped going to that Institute because of my 10th boards and covid of course but I still try to listen to songs and play them on keyboard. 

Now comes my problem.  
1. I am very One-handed. I use my right hand to play the notes ( or I should say leads) and my left hand just to play the chords and as I said, because I use keyboard I use the rhythms that are pre installed and use my left hand just to use accompany feature to change the chords as a song progresses. 
2. I am pretty weak at theory. I just know the basics such as different keys, major minor chords. 
3. As I also do singing I use both my hands to just play the chords and for fillers

Now I'm giving my 12th boards after I will be joining some college or the other. So I don't know wanna give up on my hobby since I love music more than anything. 

So, can you guys some good theory books or anything that can help me improve?

Okay so I have some stage fear. I used to give speeches and stuff during my school days, but it's been 2 years since I have ever been on a stage.
I have been playing piano (actually it's a keyboard) since some time now, but I play mostly for myself. I like to play cuz it's fun and it's a nice hobby. I have never ever ever played for any kind of audience, except for my parents, grandparents and very recently for my friends. 

There is a Talent show sorta thing in my college tmr, and my mom encouraged me to give my name and I did. I purposely chose a song that I have been familiar playing since about a year now, so that I feel confident about playing. Everything was going well, I was feeling pretty good about it. 

Suddenly today I am feeling very very nervous and the anxiety is making me overthink a lot about all the things that could potentially go wrong. I was practicing today and my hands are shaking and stuff and I'm fumbling on the keys and playing out of tempo. 

I was thinking, what if people start clapping and singing to the song and I lose my focus because of that? The clapping on the beat is a major thing, cuz most people dont know how to clap properly and im afraid I'll lose my sync. What if I go on the stage, introduce myself, sit down and just completely blank out? I'm afraid to even look at the crowd tbh. 
There was a trial dry run yesteday, and there were a couple of problems with the sound of the amplifier and stuff. The people organising said that there wont be any issues during the actual performance cuz this was a temporary situation anyways, but who is gonna tell them that my keyboard is like 10 years old and breaks down sometimes....

For some background info, I just finished learning and performing the Les Adieux sonata, Andante Spianato et Grande Polonaise Brillante, and the Rach etude op 39 no 6. I've also learned the second movement of the Chopin concerto.

Also, would either of the two movements be able to be learnt by April 2023 or is that too far of a reach?

In the video here   https://imgur.com/lQF6Ycv  and here https://imgur.com/v9hILvs   I play the same passage a few times so you can see how it goes for me.  I am practicing with and without metronome and also in different tempos. The problem is sometimes I am able to play it more or less OK but it only happens after many repetitions and never on the first try. It feels like you need to be an octopus with a separate brain for every arm. Whenever i am trying to focus on evennes in one hand the other one suffers or I change the tempo. How can I improve this? Am I doing it right and just need to keep going for weeks (or months) before I master this type of polyrhythm? Would very much appreciate any specific advice and exercise suggestions for my problem. 

Bonus questions: 

\- How do I achieve legato and nice intonation (it feels very difficult in this context)

\- Why does 3:2 rhythm feels relatively doable in some positions and a lot harder in others? So managing it in one place doesn't automatically mean you can play it anywhere. E.g. playing scales where one hand plays 2 while the other one plays 3 is a bit easier than all those twists from this piece. 

\- Should I practice every triplet separately (basically 1/4 of a measure at a time) and then join 2 and more together? I am already doind it and wondering if it makes any sense 

\- How to speed it up without scrambling the rhytm? 

\- Why do movemwnts in one hand affect the other? How to disentangle the arms? I am trying to achieve a full relaxation in arms but it takes so much mental focus... Any advice here?

1) Displaying more skill by playing from memory and just being more impressive
2) Pieces taking so much practicing to play well that they get burned into muscle memory
3) Sheet music not being useful to sightread for a very hard piece (like try sightread Feux Follets or El Contrabandista (the ones I saw)) - very fast speeds, huge leaps, passages in chords - just no time to decipher and play, so you have to memorize to not be painfully slow or gambling

The problem is sometimes I am able to play it more or less OK but it only happens after many repetitions and never on the first try. It feels like you need to be an octopus with a separate brain for every arm. Whenever i am trying to focus on evennes in one hand the other one suffers or I change the tempo. How can I improve this? Am I doing it right and just need to keep going for weeks (or months) before I master this type of polyrhythm? Would very much appreciate any specific advice and exercise suggestions for my problem. 

Bonus questions: 

\- How do I achieve legato and nice intonation (it feels very difficult in this context)

\- Why does 3:2 rhythm feels relatively doable in some positions and a lot harder in others? So managing it in one place doesn't automatically mean you can play it anywhere. E.g. playing scales where one hand plays 2 while the other one plays 3 is a bit easier than all those twists from this piece. 

\- Should I practice every triplet separately (basically 1/4 of a measure at a time) and then join 2 and more together? I am already doind it and wondering if it makes any sense 

\- How to speed it up without scrambling the rhytm? 

\- Why do movemwnts in one hand affect the other? How to disentangle the arms? I am trying to achieve a full relaxation in arms but it takes so much mental focus... Any advice here? 

Thanks a lot!",1651170926

But for some reason, I just can't get my sound to blend in, nor get any grasp of the drum's rhythm. I've tried using a mechronome, I've tried playing along to someone else's drum beat on youtube, but nothing sticks. It would really help if, anyone would be so kind, I was provided with a recording of the piano playing along to the drum in the right way, which I know I'm asking for a lot, but I'm really desperate here. Just some advice on how to keep to the drum's beat would also mean the world to me. Either way will be greatly appreciated.

I wonder if this trend is because people love these videos or because they can't read sheet music and try to play the songs by watching these videos, but honestly, given the difficulty of Patrik's songs I doubt that anyone who can't read sheet music can play more than a couple of bars.

Are the videos of Patrik Pietschmann and Rousseau more attractive than those of Kyle Landry or Francesco Parrino?

Yesterday I saw a video on Facebook of a guy playing Fur Elise on a Yamaha, but he was using the duck quack sound instead of a piano sound. I don't know WHY I found this so thrilling, but I would really like to see more. Not just ducks,but any ""normal"" song played with ""silly"" noises. I'm not really a pianist, I mostly play guitar, but I noodle with my little piano sometimes. That said, I don't know a lot of piano-specific lingo, especially not anything newer and more modern... There may be a whole weird corner of YouTube of people doing this, maybe not, I don't know. 

Is there something I could search to help me find more people using the sound effects like this? Playing music, or really anything creative with the weird sounds packaged into a lot of electric keyboards?

88,piano,Getting into teaching,"Hello there. I‚Äôm a junior in highschool and I have been playing piano for 11 going on 12 years. I‚Äôm planning on majoring in music education and maybe piano performance for a masters. And recently a friend asked me to teach them piano. Seeing as how I‚Äôm planning on making a career in teaching I figured it would be good practice and a great place to start.

I mean Iv taught little tips and tricks and ideas to people before, but Iv never tried teaching someone piano from scratch. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for what are some important things I should work on highlighting in the first few lessons, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll like give way too much information at once and I‚Äôm not sure how to pace it. All of the lesson plans Iv seen online for beginners centers around small children so how do I make it engaging for a high schooler ‚Ä¶ I really want it go well (I also kind of like this girl but that‚Äôs besides the point haha) 

I should note that they do have expiernece with *music* in that they play violin. This is really just about piano technique, learning where the notes are, etc.


TLDR I‚Äôm looking for important things I should highlight in the first few piano lessons as I try to teach my friend piano",1651012363

91,piano,The right way of learning pieces ?,"With time I'm learning harder and harder pieces like everyone. But I have noticed that I feel like I'm ""unlearning"" pieces, if I don't play them regularly (like at least once every two weeks), I have to learn it again. And it honestly discourages me a lot. I have spent about 6 months learning the first Chopin's ballade until I know it perfectly, and if I stop playing it I start to forget it. I feel like I can't at a given moment play more than 3 pieces entirely without hesitating, and these 3 pieces are the 3 last I have learnt.. Am I alone in this case ?

Maybe I'm learning the pieces the wrong way.. I'm used to recognize the harmonic progressions, but mostly to use my ""muscle memory"" in my hands, by playing the parts until I'm confident and until my hands by themselves play it. But when I'm learning new pieces, these difficult parts I learnt fade until my hands are completely disaccustom and when I learn it again it sometimes feel just like if it were the first time..

I wanted to have some feedbacks. Do you guys have to play your repertoire often in order not to forget it ? Do you spend lots of time learning a piece ? Any advice is welcome.
Thanks !",1651008820

95,piano,Losing motivation. Need some tips on getting back.,"Hello everyone. I just wanted to say that I am a beginner pianist that seemed to love piano. I just was entranced by everything, listening to anything piano related when I got the chance. I saved up for my own piano, I waited eagerly for months for it to arrive, and I sat down, and just fell in love. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, I've found myself competing with school. I'm in high school, but I seem to lack time management skills. I have had days where I don't play anything, and I've gotten to a point where I have lost the ability to read music as fast as I could.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a method and theory book, and I feel the need to redo everything in the method book as I feel that my old skills are now gone. I just feel like I set myself back a long road and I don't want to give this up. I know I truly do love piano, but I just lost the ability to enjoy it down the road. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up learning songs that were out of my skill level. They did sound ""okay,"" and while rather impressed at myself, it was just a continuous loop of replaying the same measures over and over again until I got it right.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I need a new song, but I need a new practice routine even more. I don't have a routine at the moment, but I have these resources alongside with me.

\- Alfreds Piano Book Level 1

\- Hannah Smith's sight reading book

\- Alfreds full theory book

\- musictheory(dot)net for sightreading exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I get back? I really don't want to lose any more. I want to be progressing again. Thank you all. Sorry if this doesn't belong here.",1651003485

52,piano,"About to get a new Yamaha B3, but last moment indecisiveness is holding me back. Advice?","Hello!

I've played just about every piano available in my town and have narrowed my options and budget down to a Yamaha B3; however, last minute indecisiveness is making it hard for me to make a final decision on the piano.

I've been playing on a Casio Privia for a number of years now and want to upgrade to a digital. A common story, I know. Intermediate player. 

Note there are only two piano sellers in my town: Yamaha and Steinway (which also is the Kawai dealer)

**Pros to the B3:**

* Getting a great deal on it ($7000 total after tax and delivery)
* It's about the same height as the U1 and K300
* The sound is really rich; it's much fuller than the B2 or K200, neither of which I loved
* The store has a trade-in program for any future piano purchases (just has to be 500 dollars more expensive than my current model)
* I like the idea of new with a 10 year warranty
* The B3 is the second favorite upright I've played so far (the first being the Kawai K300)

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns**

* I have an old family 2004 Pearl River EUP118 I could ship over from out of state if I wanted--Wouldn't this be smarter even if it hasn't been serviced in years?
* It's not a Japan made piano even if it's the same size
* I went into this wanting a K300, but the lowest I could get the only Kawai dealer in town down to was $9,800 total
* I'm worried it's going to be too loud in my house
* The trade-up system locks me into the Yamaha family of pianos since this is a Yamaha dealer, which means no trading it up for any other brand in the future
* 7,000 dollars is enough money that it makes me wonder if I should wait another year, keep saving, and purchase a new K300, which is still the best upright I've played, although that dealer (Steinway/Kawai) doesn't have a good trade up program (the new piano has to be double the price)

Just on one last quick note, the Yamaha store also had a 1985 U1 in a good shape for 6,000, but honestly, the new B3 sounded and felt a lot better. 

Anyway, that's where I'm at. I was hoping to get any wisdom you might have here.",1650927918

63,piano,Suggestions for my first piano concerto?,"Hey guys, so in about 6 months my piano school will be doing a concert and my teacher wants to do a duet with me (we did one in the last concert and it went well). He said he wants to do a piano concerto with 2 pianos. He wants to do chopin 1 which got me pretty excited since I love it, but I'm worried it's too far above my level, I've only been learning since Nov 2020 and only had a teacher since Nov 2021.

I've had a look at the score for chopin piano concerto 1 and played it a bit, I think it is doable but it'll take a while, we might only be doing 1 movement so I think I could at least learn one, but probably not to as high of a standard as I'd be happy with.

He's not set on chopin 1 so a couple others I was thinking of if we can only do 1 movement is rach 2 2nd movement and mozart 20 1st movement, I think those sound pretty easy and [the mozart one sounds great on 2 pianos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUvxNB-p-50).

Anyways, I'd like to hear some suggestions on piano concertos that would be suitable for someone like me and sounds good on 2 pianos.

I need your help. I will try and decide if im smart enough to get involved with all this, hopefully.

I have a Kawai CL30r, insides of which you can see in the photos, which is 17 years old and has been sitting for the last 5. I got it back from my hometown recently and realised the volume out of the speakers and the headphones is super low, on both L and R.

1. What part(s) could be leading to the problem, and if you don't mind, what is that part called? (maybe even some general idea of what is what, if you can tell from the photo)

68,piano,Is it even worth to learn with that advancement in technology? Whats the purpose of amateur playing?,"Ok. I am getting 22 yo soon and I want to clear my room and make some adjustments. And then it was time to get rid of my old piano.  I was practicing with it for 6 years ( 4-10 yo). I was pretty decent, probably  talented, but gave zero effort because I lost interest and I was more of a music lover in general than a musician. Anyway, I had an argument with my parents about selling it. They told me that I could start practicing it again and keep it. It is true that playing piano was enjoyable and I missed it some times but nothing special.  I have practiced flute too and I am in dilemma with it too(If I continue flute piano will be good to have). Btw, the thing is that the argument with my parents was around why should I learn piano at 22? I am not planning becoming pro on it so no money from it, I can use synthesiser instead if needed,  I can listen all the piano classics from my Computer and in general I do not find a reason for me to practice it again. Ok, it is enjoyable and relaxing, but even If I start it again I would not have time or money for lessons. Thus only learning the basics again, some songs and thats all.

Whats your opinion? To sell it or to keep it?

I wanted to learn op 10 no 3, but my teacher thinks it might be too hard because of the middle section.

op 10 no 5 seems fun but seems difficult to do cleanly at tempo.

op 10 no 6 is a very pretty piece but i'm sure it's very very challenging musically.

op 10 no 9 is nice but I'd rather learn another one.

op 10 no 12 is also nice but I don't know if I want to waste my time doing a left hand study.

Out of the op 25 set, I'll also exclude the ones that are obviously too difficult: 4, 6, 8, 10, 11

op 25 no 1 was one my teacher suggested as well, very pretty but honestly not as cool as some of the others IMO

op 25 no 2 isn't really my favorite, i'd prefer not

op 25 no 3 seems ok but i've heard from some is really hard

op 25 no 5 i really like this piece but its probably too hard

op 25 no 7 is really pretty but slow and I wonder if I should be learning a fast etude plus its very difficult musically

But I feel that my pianotecnique is slowly fading away. And I feel that I'm getting worse, cus my ""harder"" pieces are forgotten. And the songs I play now are easy and basically just chords. Next year I'm going to study in the conservatoire (jazz/pop/rock spesifically) I asked my pianoteacher for exercises, but he wants to focus on chords and leadsheets.

at the lesson, he asked me to play something i am working on - cristoforis' dream.  i can play the piece but have trouble with the 16th notes later in the piece.  i lack quickness.  we spent the entire lesson going over 2 measures that i made a mistake on - due to nervousness.  i do not play at all in front of people, and this being the center of attention has been a lifelong issue, nothing new here.  at 64, when i was a teen in school i would take an F on an oral report rather than standing in front of the class.  


anyway, the lesson came and went, the teacher promised to send material.  4 days later, nothing.  i try to be patient, but having spent 30 minutes on 2 measures and paying for that - i cancelled our next lesson.    his reply was  ""we just met and I need to see how you take my advice and use it in one lesson""  While i can understand how this works, i also don't believe in paying someone to go over 2 measures in a piece i don't normally make a mistake on.

21,piano,Losing ability to play piano,"Just a question if anyone has experienced something similar and a fix.

Been playing for 4 years, with former experience younger. Not classically trained and been self learning as a hobby. 

I'm not capable of sight reading so I memorise all pieces I play. I've practiced everyday since day 1, taking a day off every 2-3 weeks when I feel off.

I play every piece I've learnt at least once each day, so about 2 hours of playing and 1 extra hour when learning new pieces. Generally I can play consistently with minor mistakes.

Problem:
About 1 month ago, I've begun to have huge freezes and begun stuttering (more like a spasm on the same notes) and now incapable of completing any of the pieces I've been playing everyday, even ones from 4 years ago.

It wasn't a gradual problem, it was instant but it's lasted so long now even taking 1-2 days off, I see no improvement.

Does anyone have any suggestions of what might be causing this or if they've had something similar happen at least once? Nothing big has happened lately, and nothing else seems to be affected outside of piano, so I'm not sure if it's a brain related issue.",1650851991

27,piano,What to learn AFTER the beginner stage?,"Hey everyone! I've been a musician for about 15-20 years now so I'm definitely not a beginner, but when it comes to piano I do get a little lost. 

Obviously, with my musical background, I understand music theory, notes, chords, what makes a chord, different variations, etc. We all know I could go on for a while. 

I've been learning to sight read and have gotten fairly decent at it, and I've been doing a bunch of exercises to help me get better at playing a piece with both hands in one fluid action, instead of separating them. One problem I've run into though is the level of sight reading I'm at compared to the capabilities of playing is just waaaaay different. I understand I have to work my way up, but playing insanely simple pieces is rather boring. (No disrespect intended!)

I'm just not sure what to learn! With instruments such as guitar, after learning most of the basics and venturing out into intermediate territory, learning and playing new songs opened up my ""library"" of techniques, licks, specific scales and how to use them, things like that, but a piano feels pretty foreign to me. 

Should I just keep building upon my knowledge of scales and learning to use them on piano? Learn some songs perhaps? With where I'm at with sight reading, I feel ""forced"" to play insanely easy songs as that's what level my reading is at, but my hands just feel a bit bored if that makes any sense.

32,piano,Best video for learning the right way,"Hi, sorry about my english.

I just bought a piano after a long pause. When I was younger I could play alot of ""hard"" song. I was autodidact and I learn how to read the note on a sheet. I knew how to read each note individually but I could not read anything about the tempo. I had to listen to the song to figure the tempo. 

My school teacher was a piano teacher and she was always surprised how I could play song without the right techniques. My fingers were all over the place. 

Basically, my learning methods was to look the note on a sheet and play it till I could just play it mechanicaly. I was not able to sit and play without taking time to decrypt each note one by one. 

I would like to play ""the right way"". I would like to be able to just sit in front of a sheet and play it even if I never heard the song just like my teacher was. 

Know I try to learn again and with a step back I see how my method was conter productive and ineffective. I want to be able to lear a partition just like I read a book. I want to have the right techniques with my finger. Since I didnt play since a decade I want to take this occasion to kearn to play the right way. 

My teacher was asking me to do arpege to learn how to read fluidly and to place my finger correctly. Is there were I should start ? 

Do you have any YouTube channel that show all the basic to suggest ? thanks !",1650842506

46,piano,Roland RD-88 vs Casio PX-S3100 Privia for an intermediate player,"Background: I have been playing the piano since my childhood over more than 13 years (mostly classical repertoire). However about 6 months ago I had to move to a different country for my studies and I had to sell my old acoustic upright piano for around 1000 euros (It wasn't that fancy and it was old). 

I wanted to return to my hobby but in the meantime I also learned more and more about electronic music producing and DAWs. 

My question is: 

So I want to get a *76-88  keys, fully weighted Digital/stage piano with pitch wheel* (I want to also use it with DAWs but don't want to give up classical music so fully weighted is a must) 

Roland RD-88 seems like the perfect choice but it's little over my budget but I can strech (1100 euros) but had better key action than casio (around 850 eur) HOWEVER I have to also buy a case (I cannot use them on my study table all the time so I will have to store them) 

So is it a good investment in the long term if I buy the Roland and store it in a cheap case or should I better stick with casio (good key action but worse than Roland) and save some money?

If you have any other recommendations please write down :)",1650821712

I (16M) find myself as a relatively strong student: I am at the top of my class with a 4.0 GPA, Several AP classes, along with various extracurriculars (including piano). That being said, the vast amount of colleges out there not only intimidate me, but have me concerned that I will not find what I am looking for- that being a university that has Steinway pianos that would be available for me to play at my liking. I‚Äôve done a bit of research myself and I believe a school that suits this preference relatively well is Stanford, however knowing the competitive academic environment we are currently in, this may not be an option. Knowing this, I was hoping that reaching out to those with knowledge and/or experience with universities in the US would be able to provide some help as to what schools would best suit my interests.

56,piano,Roland FP90X or LX705 or?,"Hello Redditors,

TLDR: FP90X or LX705?

My first post here and on Reddit! As title says I‚Äôm looking to get a new digital piano mainly for home practice so I‚Äôm looking for some specific feedback and advice on the above models I‚Äôm considering.

I am looking for a new digital piano having had a few years‚Äô hiatus after sadly selling my old acoustic upright during a house move. Ideally I‚Äôm looking for the best recreation of an acoustic piano (sound &amp; touch) with a good selection of features (a backing track/AI band would be cool) and other sounds/songs to play with at around ¬£1500. Portability is also useful as I may be moving again soon or perhaps start gigging (in the far future), but not essential as this will be a practice piano. I did get to Grade 5 standard so I‚Äôm also looking for a fairly advanced/intermediate piano where I can appreciate those features/nuances as I get back to that level.

After a few months of research and a visit to my local piano shop, I have found the Roland selection very appealing, especially the PHA50 action. Being a Yamaha fan I thought I‚Äôd like the P515 but found the action too heavy and not as customisable as the Roland, I also find the Roland modelling approach creates a more accurate and realistic sound.

Ultimately this has led me to the FP90X and LX705 - they are similarly priced at my local store. Firstly, can anyone that has played these offer any feedback please, particularly the LX705 as I haven‚Äôt found many reviews? Is the LX705 just a fancier/cosmetic version of the FP90X? Are the FP and LX series noticeably better than the HP i.e HP704? Is the speaker setup and playback good enough on the FP90X or does the layout on the LX705 make a difference? As the FP series was recently updated, are there significant updates to the sound engine compared to that of the LX705 or are the PureAcoustic sounds/engine identical? Also are Roland likely to update the LX series soon too? Are there others I should also be considering? What are the intermediate Yamaha alternatives?

Thanks in advance!",1650805591

61,piano,"I've played the piano for years and years, but I still don't have any sort of proper structure in my practise and I'd like to fix that","So when I practise, normally I'll sit down, maybe go through a new passage slowly, which sort of doubles as a warmup, then play through a piece, see which bits need work, and then practise those, which works ok, but when I'm distracted and not really switched on it doesn't work as well, so I'd like a proper routine I can fall back on for a 2-3 hour practise session?


I guess in terms of where I am with the piano and what my goals are, I've finished grades 1-8 and the ATCL and LTCL, I'm sort of considering going for the FTCL but at the same time, I'm kind of sick of using external stuff for motivation and it sort of boxes me into doing a pretty small set of just difficult repertoire when I might want to do easier stuff because I enjoy it. I really enjoy playing, like I look forward to practising, enjoy practising, super happy after practising, I really love just being in the music centre at uni and hearing people practise and being surrounded by music, so I don't think there's any big motivation issues, it's just needing a bit more structure in my practise? 


For goals, I'm sort of just trying to be more well-rounded as a musician. That means playing a wider range of repertoire, in terms of composers, time periods, all that stuff, and just expanding my general music knowledge, so in terms of finding repertoire any advice would be great. I feel like it takes me way longer to learn pieces now compared to when I was younger, and I'm still like, young, so hopefully I haven't peaked, but yeah it's weird. I spent most of my time in the music centre at school, like basically all of my time outside of classes, but I didn't practise much tbh, I was mostly just using it as a space to avoid people, but I don't know if that sort of just added up over time? I was sort of hoping that having a more organised approach to practise might speed stuff up since I have less practise time now. 


I also want to work on my sight reading and playing from ear, and theory, which are all kind of related, and I guess that ties into the whole finding repertoire thing, and playing easier stuff, because obviously I'm not going to be able to sight read really hard stuff without practising that skill first. 


I got told at a masterclass in the past that in terms of practise structure, I was supposed to do something like, scales, then Bach, then pieces, or something like that? I think that advice was under the assumption that I was wanting to go and study music, but is that what I should be aiming for or?",1650794082

Well the current value of the Roland is $900. 30-40% would be $360-270.  But, seeing that I paid $475 for it in 2016,  I think $360 would be a pretty good deal if I could get it.

I was wondering if this is some kind of ornamentation I'm not aware of, like is it acceptable by baroque players to adjust notes like this?

* I've recently been listening to ""less popular"" composers like Godowsky. Love his Waltzes. **Any recommendations**?
* Schubert was absolutely brilliant. 

**Technique**:

* It's really important to be confident with ledger line notes. 
* Play super duper slow at first. Please! Don't speed up until you have it right ... and once you get it right, keep playing it until you *know* you can't get it wrong. Csikszentmihaly's [**flow theory**](https://positivepsychology.com/theory-psychology-flow/) is your friend! 

&gt;*Flow is the complete immersion in an activity that you deem enjoyable in some way. This doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not challenging. In fact, the activity must challenge you just enough to push you.*   
&gt;  
&gt;***Your skills must be tested****. Flow activities excite us, provide intrinsic rewards, and help us develop our skills.*

* Double sharps/flats and key signatures with many sharps and flats shouldn't scare you away ‚Äî keep practicing pieces in more ""complex"" key and sight reading will come naturally. Eventually the concept that **C-flat** is the same tone as **B** will *B* (hehe) normal. **Challenge yourself to play every double-sharped/double-flatted/natural sign without making mistakes.**
* Counting rhythm becomes instinctual once you know how long a note should last relative to another.
* Tension is your biggest enemy. 
* If you're playing a phrase that requires a swift ""rocking"" motion of the forearm/wrist/hand, try to visualize a bright red arrow quickly shifting in appropriate directions while practicing that particular passage. This has helped me a lot! **Any other technique hacks**?",1650722776

I was just told to listen to how certain chords and keys felt to me and what kind of impression they gave me. And Idon't mean Major or Minor, I'm really talking about the certain feelings of different chords and how to change it by playing a single key different. So whenever I learn something new on the piano I'll try and listen to how the sounds make me feel. If, for example, I play C-major in a melody, I'll know if I play something wrong, not just because it doesn't sound like C-major, but because I learned that this chord resembles 'home'. So if it doesn't feel like home, I know that it's not C. Again, not from the sound itself but from the feeling I get from the sound.

Now long story short: Did anyone learn to play the piano in a similar way? Because I kinda feel like there aren't as many people knowing that as I thought there would be? Idk but if anyone knows if this is a common thing or if i just had a weird teacher, please let me know :)",1650710323

77,piano,Do any quality works use the lowest and highest notes of an 88-key piano? 85-key?,"The first pianoforte had 60 notes.  Broadwood ""were the first firm to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves + a [fifth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth) during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (Beethoven used the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820.""  By ""seven octaves"" I think that means not 7x12 (=84) but 7x12+1 (=85, A to A).     

If the first 85-key was made in 1820, that doesn't tell us when they became standard, but I'll guess most skilled piano composers had them by 1835.   

Chopin died 1849.

Steinway introduced the 88-key piano in the 1880s (1884?  That was the year of the first ""D-274"").  

Lizst died 1886. 

Do any well-known / well-respected works for piano use the lowest and highest notes of an 85 or 88 key piano?  If not, do any novelty works (with at least a moderate degree of musical intelligence)?

Do any respectable works use all 85 or all 88 keys (not just lowest and highest)?",1650646511

Right now, this sounds really hard because it's taken me month(s) to learn one of my first songs that I've been excited to play (ones that aren't ""work""and other foundation stuff)

What does this feel like? Does it feel like going backwards?

I am an artist of another type, so I do understand what it feels like to enjoy the process and create new works, to hang it up on my wall and move onto and get excited about the next project ..

But for piano, it does seem a little disheartening, thinking that what I really want to play now, once I achieve it, will be annoyingly difficult.

I guess, I just want to get to a point where I can go to my piano and play things I know, not necessarily learning and fumbling. Don't get me wrong, I really love the learning process.

I‚Äôd like to start to try playing with both hands, but - as I‚Äôm sure the majority of you would‚Äôve found when you first started to learn - my brain just cannot comprehend one of my hands playing a certain pattern and my other hand playing something completely different.

For me it was a little weird, I had always wanted to learn the piano, but decided on the guitar because I thought it was easier.

17,piano,"How does a Kawai MP11SE compare an ES920, when trying to achieve near-acoustic results?","**Introduction: (Not required to read)**

I am a university student, and classical pianist. I've had opportunities to practice an a variety of instruments, primarily acoustic, but I've decided that I want to get something for my home, so I can practice more. My budget doesn't allow for an upright, so I plan on going digital. I looked through that FAQ, and there was a lot of good information, but I felt much of it factored in things that don't matter to me at all. I looked through some of the linked threads, but some of them are 11 years old, and I'm not sure how up-to-date many of the choices are. So, that's my reason for making this. If it is still too generic a post, let me know, and I'll remove it. 

**What is important to me:** 

1. A ""feel"" as close to acoustic as possible. I am guessing that any weighted keyboard should be *okay* for my needs, but if possible, I want to get as close as I can to the feeling of playing an acoustic. 
2. As close to a ""realistic"" piano sound as I can get. To be frank, I could not care less about any sounds apart from the relevant piano options. I will not use them, and if a product has amazing piano sounds but awful e-piano or strings sounds, that's perfectly fine. 

**What is not important to me:** 

1. Portability. I would get a hybrid, but they're a bit outside of my price range as far as I know. The reduced weight of the ES920 is not a factor for me, and I will not be doing ""gigs"" or anything like that with it. It'll just stay in my home. 
2. The sound selection. I mentioned it above, but the only sounds that matter to me are the piano ones. 

For those of you with experience, which of the two options feels more like an acoustic piano? My understanding is that they sound essentially the same, and the biggest difference is how they feel. Or, is there an option in a similar price range that feels / sounds more like an acoustic?",1650479303

My main issue is that I don‚Äôt want to take lessons because of how expensive the local teachers are, and from what I‚Äôve seen people seem to be saying that you really should have actual in-person lessons to get anywhere.

I can play a few pieces decently, but still can not play a single classical piece, just because I had no interest at all. But recently I got to know Rachmaninoff's prelude in G minor (23. 5) and now I have that song in my head all the time.

I looked it up and it seems that the difficulty is near Moonlight Sonata, so I guess it'll be too hard for me now. The only pieces I know are way above my skill range, so I would like some recommendations of classical pieces that is appropriate to me.

Since I cannot play a single classical piece, I just decided to upload a video of me playing. (It's an anime song called God Knows... btw.) I think I am capable of Clair de Lune or Chopin's Nocturne 9-2, but I'm afraid I might get bored since I like fast-paced and strong songs (like the 23. 5 Prelude).

Any critique of my performance is also welcome. I did mess it up at the end though.

The features that appeal are that it's got split-key capability to have identical pitch mirrored, semi-weighted yet still standard sized keys, and a built in speaker (we don't need it sound amazing), and the price is great (note the link is Canadian dollars).

Would this piano be alright or are there big red flags? If he keeps going, we'll upgrade in a few years.

*In short:*  
*- ADHD*  
*- Can identify every note on sheets but can't read sheets or books (like all pages blank)*  
*- Thought about having someone annotate sheets for me but not sure*

Story time:  
It was years ago before I lost my piano that I gave up on it. I always made small progress slow. I could play the whole piece if I could remember it, but to sightread was like to read a blank page - my focus was everywhere on the page.

I was so in love with piano that I wanted to run away from it. Fast forward idkhm years, I took an approach that helped me *a lot* \- writing down every note on the sheets. It has been very efficient. That said, reading the sheets and annotating them has always been painful, and I thought about having someone who could read them in a snap do that for me. As I did, I couldn't help but wonder: Do I have other options? And if I don't, shall I re-accept the fact that I, indeed, am talentless and just get by?

11,piano,Small portable keyboard for traveling?," Hi

I'm a beginner piano player (about 1 year at this point) and during the summer I'm going to be travelling a lot (work related) and I can't bring my e-piano with me since it's too large and impractical to carry. However, I would really like to continue practice as much as possible even though I'm travelling, and figured that perhaps I could buy myself a smaller keyboard.

I'm basically looking for a keyboard that is very light in weight, with less keys. The fewer keys, the easier to carry. But if there are too few keys I guess I won't be able to play any repertoire - however that doesn't necessarily have to be a problem as I could perhaps use the time to just do **piano technique exercises** and **sight-reading exercises**? Most important thing for me is to just keep up with the practice so I don't lose my motivation.

All ideas are appreciated!",1650348499

I am going to try to attend local PTG meetings and talk to a few technicians that my friends/family have used. I would love any advice you have time to give, but I do have a few specific questions:

* What general area do you work in and how much demand is there for piano tuners in your area? I‚Äôve heard that demand for piano tuners varies widely by area.
* What is your typical day/week/month like? How many pianos do you tune per day?
* Do you own/run your own business? Is running a one-person business a lot of work?
* How did your work change during and after the pandemic? Tuners in my area have a 4-6 month waitlist right now, and I‚Äôm not sure if this is how it‚Äôs always been in the field or if this is artificial/temporary demand created by people not being able to work during the pandemic.
* In your experience, has demand for this work been increasing or decreasing over the years?
* Opinions on North Bennet Street School in Boston, or any of the other hands-on, in-person programs listed on the PTG website ([https://www.ptg.org/ptgmain/technicians/education](https://www.ptg.org/ptgmain/technicians/education))? General opinions on formal education vs apprenticeship? I am leaning towards pursuing education at an actual trade school. I personally prefer the structure of higher education and I‚Äôm afraid that apprenticeships or at-home programs will leave me with gaps in my knowledge/experience and that an actual trade school will give me a more well-rounded education and a faster track into the career. This one in Boston looks like a very complete program and promises hands-on experience as well as training on how to build and run your own business. I can‚Äôt find a lot of outside information on it or any of the other ones, though. What kind of reputation do they have in the field? Any alumni here that can tell me about their experience? (bonus question: will that school prepare me for the RPT exam?)

Howdy,    so I am wondering if we use the same rules for such other scales and    modes as the ""Prometheus Scale"" as we would for the Natural scales by    applying a flat 3, 5, and 9  for minor, #5, #9, and #11 for augmented    chords, flat 3 and 5 for diminished 7 chords.

Hmm, this is kind of what I figured is the case, just taking a natural scale and applying the minor/dim/aug rules to it.

Also lets say we have a G# ""Prometheus Scale"" and I wanted to write this out in a long scale, such as

G#, A#, C, D, E# (F), F#, G# , \_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,\_\_\_,

would    I just apply the same formula that was used to build the first notes   of  the Octave? Or, hmm I am kind of in the middle of thinking you just    repeat the same notes all the way up right?

Hmm    though I don't think this is correct, since in other cases I have   found  scales that when choosing notes for large chords these notes are    different on the higher octave compared to the first octave.

Well    thanks for any help you can provide, in the meantime I am going to    search around for some literature or videos on this topic.",1650314807

Hi all, hoping to get a bit of advice for my partner who is learning piano and wants to upgrade her keyboard, she currently has a keyboard that is not touch sensitive and has 61 keys.¬†

She has been looking online and knows that 88 touch sensitive, fully weighted keys are a necessity. Whilst looking there seems to be a few brands popping up but we are unsure what to go for. In terms of price she would ideally like it to be under ¬£300 but is also aware that you get what you pay for. Do any of you have any recommendations for this price or what else to look out for?¬†

We have seen a great deal for the Casio CDP S100 with 88 fully weighted keys or the Alesis recital with 88 semi weighted keys but wondered if either of those would be sufficient? She has also taken interest in the Yamaha P45, so if something like that would be better please do let me know.¬†

Any recommendations or tips would be greatly appreciated!",1650297459

93,piano,I've quit. My huge appreciation to all of you who can play,"I've officially quit after some time of trying to play for a couple of years. I tried learning both on my own and with 2 teachers. I think I failed mostly because music isn't my passion. My reason for trying was psychotherapy and because I read about the benefits for the brain.

But the truth is, music itself is not my passion. I have no genuine interest in it. I would practice the little songs from my teachers, but to me, it was like doing school homework. I practised in order not to embarrass myself in the next lesson, but to be honest, that was it.

There were times when playing actually helped with anxiety. It did help ground me. It did help against OCD thoughts.

But overall, I found as time went on, the stress created by practise and the fear of my lessons was larger than the occasional positive effects.

I don't regret trying. At least I learnt something and I saw just how difficult it is.
I sincerely admire all of you who keep playing and who find joy in this beautiful hobby.

Since the OP is a begginer, the answer could be a bit different in my case, bit of context here:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Girlfriend is a begginer, played some violin, and wants to start piano

\- Myself, have been playing for a few years (with interuptions). My level is heterogenous as fuck, I played some advanced pieces(such as Cypr√®s de la Villa d'Este from Liszt) but my technique (and practise technique) is very weak. I can benefit from such app for the following: working on pure technique, improving sight reading, and rythm

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently testing Yousician. So far I like it, I think it can help me improve what I need. I already saw some downfalls I does not like (such as the workout just stopping when the rythm is not good, I would prefer it to continue and then have a debrief, and maybe an exercice focused on where I missed). Also if possible, an app that could display the French notes notations (Do Re Mi etc ...) instead of C/D/E would be great

60,piano,What should I do?,"Hi! I've been playing for a year and half now, with a teacher. To be honest I'm a bit disappointed with what I've achieved so far. 

I'm taking classical piano lessons so naturally most of my time has been spent on learning various classical piano pieces, techniques and music theory, which I do enjoy. However learning new music is done through mostly reading/sight-reading sheets.  
***I do not feel like I'm learning the piano and feel more like I'm a human jukebox.*** It's like I am in a foreign country and all I can do is say a couple of essential phrases from a travel guide.  Take away my sheets or smack me on the head so I forget what pieces I've memorized and I have nothing to show.  
**How do I actually acquire piano/musical fluency and start improvising/composing or playing by ear?** Right now whenever I listen to a song, it's really difficult for me to say what chords are being played or how I can transcribe/translate it to the piano.  


Is this the standard way on how they teach classical piano? Most of my lessons were focused on:  
1. Music Theory (scales, chords and etc)  
2. Performance skills (Correct fingerings, various techniques and other technical stuff)  
3. Reading and Sight-reading.

4. Rhythm exercises (polyrhythms, metronome drills)",1650189687

I have a maximum budget of ~600$. Ideally, I would have liked to buy the Roland FP10, but it is out of stock here in the US. I was thinking of going for the Yamaha P45 for 550$. Recently, I came across a listing in Thomann (a major German online music store) which is selling the Kawai ES110 for 583$ (incl shipping to US). The Kawai Es110 retails for ~900$ here in the US. I also researched and found that there is no import duty for items less than $800 here in the US and hence, I don't expect any additional imports/customs duty.

Here are a few questions where I'd appreciate some advice

1. Do you think it makes sense for me to take the risk and spend the extra 33$ and get the Kawai ES110 instead of the Yamaha P45? I have no experience whatsoever in playing a piano, but I am planning to learn seriously and don't want to regret my purchase decision in a few years. 

2. Can anyone share some of their experiences buying from Thomann (shipping to the US)? Is the warranty legit, did you face any issues with the potential voltage differences between Europe and US, any shipping/transit damages, Thomann's customer service, etc?

3,piano,Beginner question - depth of fingers in key bed and awkwardness when changing chord fingerings,"Hi there, just to start, I did check the FAQ and couldn't really find info on this.  So, I've been self taught and dabbled with keys for some years now as a music producer.  But, now I'm playing keys in a band and am trying to take my technique more seriously.

My question is regarding how deep you should put your fingers in the keybed for playing chords.  For example, when playing diatonic chords in C major, I've always had my fingertips more towards me, on the first inch and a half of the keybed below the black keys.  Obviously, when changing to different keys it requires playing sharps and flats, and some chords I'm playing require my thumb to be on a black key.  This requires vertical Y axis movement of my whole hand for my thumb to reach a black key.

Here's a practical example that illustrates my question.  I'm practicing arpeggios of 7th chords in the key of F major, root-3-5-7 fingerings.  When I get to the 4 and 5 chord (Bbmaj7 and C7 respectively), I have to alter my hand depth so my thumb and pinky hit the Bb key.  This can cause inaccuracies at certain tempos.

So, does this just require more practice time to nail this hand adjustment, or should I be keeping my hand deeper on the keybed in general?  I've found keeping my hand deeper results in awkwardness when trying to play chords that use all white keys (Cmaj7 for example) because I then have to navigate fingertips across the black keys and will accidently hit them.  I just am curious what you guys would recommend, because as a fairly experienced guitarist, I know practicing bad habits takes a long time to fix.  Just want to make sure I'm practicing correct technique.

Thanks!",1650136663

5,piano,Retaining of Piano Technique / Pieces getting harder as I get older.,"36 year amatuer piano player here - played from age 5 to 19, then took a break and picked it up again around age 33. 

one very frustrating thing I've noticed picking piano again is that I my brain doesn't seem to retain new technique/pieces I've learned. 

Example - Learning Rach 2, spent months and months on it - diligantly playing slow/etc and gradually speeding it up while playing consistently (every other day at least on it), until suddenly the piece feels ""locked in"" my hands - if that makes any sense? like it ""flows"" easily - the technique no longer feels awkward, it feels natural - similar to how you practice any new skill until it no longer feels awkward. 

Except, when I take a break for a week, I go back to the piano and it's like I LOST the ""natural flow I had"". like my brain didn't ""absorb"" anything. so I sit and start again - slow.....working my way up..etc. OK, so I lock it in again. take a week break. come back...same thing. and so on and so on. 

Everytime I go through this cycle, the time it takes to get back to the ""flow state"" technique wise becomes shorter and shorter in duration, but still WAY too long  - I cannot spend all the this time rebuilding my technique every time. 

Here is an example: 

1. 10 hours to get to ""flow state"" for a piece. 
2. Take a 3-5 day break
3. 8 hours to get to same""flow state"" for the piece
4. Take a 3-5 day break
5. 7 days to get to ""flow state"" for a piece.

and so on and so on. 

And no, I cannot play every day to to life obligations/working on other pieces. 

Is this normal? is there a better way to ""retain"" technique? What is going on here?",1650132666

I have learned fur elise (easy part), rondo alla turca (to that first run after RH octaves) and first 84 bars from nothing else matters from scot d. Davis... That nothing else matters is why I started, that is my goal to be able to play it, but this is waaay above my current level so its going way to slow to keep me interested... That is way i learned fur elise and why i am learning mozart... I want to add to my repertoire some simple (one page, maybe two) and fun pieces that i can practice with, i only know 3 pieces so that gets boring really quickly... I am looking for some teacher and trying to learn theory but i want to just sit and play something shor just for fun... Iam for every level, i like challenge of rondo alla turca, took me while to learn it, but at a same time i loved stupid simple jingle bells that came to my mind latelly and thats what i am learning now :)

Any advices for pieces/songs that are short, maybe simple or maybe harder? I dont care about difficulty, but really want something short and nice/fun...",1650121825

 I initially made a post asking about what the best choice between a Kawai ES-110 or a Yamaha P-125 would be. Although, with recent price changes, the full triple pedal, wood stand and good height adjustable piano bench set would be just under the price (about a 150 to 200‚Ç¨ difference) of better stationary pianos that have all of those included and are of much higher quality.

And so, my question now is if it would be better to go for a Yamaha YDP-164 for about 980‚Ç¨ or a Casio AP-470 for 950‚Ç¨ and a bench included.

I have always been referenced as someone with a 'Musical ear'. Although I have never mastered an instrument, I self taught myself some piano songs, and have loved the emotions music can give. Infact, recently I fell in love with an instrument, that I research and listen to every day. It is the only thing in life I crave at the moment. It is called a Tsugaru Shamisen. However, my parents are hesitant on getting one for me, as this instrument is expensive, and difficult to master alone. (The instrument is rare among the U.S.A).

However, my dad made a deal with me. If I could 'learn an instrument' which I decided to be the piano because it is the only instrument I own, then he would buy me the Tsugaru Shamisen. However, this means I have to learn more about music. I need to learn how to read notes, identify notes and keys, and eventually play advanced songs. I know it is hard work, but I am up for it. Knowing this, is it possible if I do not have access to a teacher and must learn myself with my materials listed in the bold question above?",1650069812

W.Hoffman V126 Var with silent system.  Apparently there was one other renter that had it before me so it's not completely new.

Dynamics are very important to me; I want to be able to play softly and more loudly when a piece demands it. It's very important to me that my instrument is expressive.

I've heard about the Roland pianos in the same price range having heavier action and perhaps more controllable dynamics, but I really love the feel of Yamaha action and sound.

Context:
I‚Äôm a 17 y/o high school senior. I started learning piano casually in Jan. 2021, just for something fun to do during covid.(Parents bought me a Yamaha P-45 which is what I still use.) I Quickly developed a passion classical music and began more structured practice in the summer, making sure to practice scales, technical exercises, music theory etc. on top of classical repertoire. Decided in September I wanted to take piano lessons with a private teacher who my pianist friend referred me to. In just 7 months with him I‚Äôve learned all 6 Clementi Sonatinas, a handful of Chopin waltzs and mazurkas, and just finished up Chopin Nocturnes no. 2 and 20. 

Im truly not trying to pump myself up or sound like I‚Äôm full of myself, I just want to really emphasize how important music has become to me. With that being said, the Yamaha P-45 I have practiced on for the past year and a quarter just doesn‚Äôt cut it for me. It sounds bland, uninspiring, and mechanical, which makes sense with it being an entry level digital keyboard. It has ‚Äúweighted‚Äù keys, but they still feel light and jiggly, which makes it‚Äôs especially difficult to play fast passages smoothly at tempo. The studio piano I play once a week at lessons, even being beat up from presumably 20+ years of hours of playing everyday still sounds and feels 100x better. When I‚Äôm playing it, everything flows much better, I feel a wider range of dynamics, and there‚Äôs a certain inspiring emotion about playing on an acoustic piano that I just don‚Äôt get on my digital piano. I‚Äôve asked my parents a few times now about the possibility of getting a used upright and they‚Äôve kinda blown it off, giving short and standard responses like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have access to a piano in college,‚Äù and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just wait a little.‚Äù I understand that their concerns are valid, an acoustic piano is a luxury item and comes with constant maintenance, and is far less convenient than a digital keyboard. And I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with an entry level instrument like what I have for people who just want to have fun with it, but it is less than ideal for people like myself who work hard and aspire to become talented musicians. 

Sorry for the rant and if I came across as bratty. I‚Äôve been hesitant to ask them again as I don‚Äôt want them to think I am ungrateful. Should I keep trying to convince them or should I cut my losses and just deal with it until I move out and can afford a piano? Any advice or comments are appreciated.

17,piano,Kawai CA49 vs Kawai CA79 for basic recording,"I plan to play acoustic piano songs or accompaniments and looking for a natural sound with a realistic action and that led me to consider the CA49 and CA79. Clavinova is an option but heard it doesn't have wooden/realistic action.

I'm debating between CA49 and CA79 and idunno if I can justify the price difference when for me the main difference is:

1. better acoustic piano sound samples - this may not matter as I may opt to use MIDI instead of the audio signal, but if I do choose to record the audio signal, this will matter a lot
2. action - CA79 has longer keys and more realistic action

What doesn't matter:

1. Speakers don't matter at all, as this would not be used for live performance
2. All the fancy extra sounds don't matter
3. other extraneous features that may appear on more expensive models - fancy UI, etc.

42,piano,"Any pianists here suffer from strabismus (""lazy eye"")?","I've had strabismus all my life, a condition (erroneously called ""lazy eye"") which means that my eyes don't work in unison. My specific condition is ""esotropia"", which I can ever only look out of one eye at a time, and the other eye turns inwards. I'm also ""alternating"", which means I switch the eye I look out of from time to time, sometimes rapidly.

This condition means that I don't have depth perception, my field of view is limited, and it means that when I ""switch"" the eye I look out of, the whole world ""shifts"".

I started learning classical piano a few years ago as an adult. This has been a huge obstacle in learning piano. For example:

- I cannot ever see both of my hands at the same time;

- I judge distances on the keys poorly, which makes leaps of my hand difficult;

- When I switch from looking at my right hand with my right eye to my left hand with my left eye, the whole keyboard ""shifts"", and because the keyboard is a repeating pattern of keys, I easily get confused;

- I read notes with my dominant eye, which makes my other eye very tired when I disengage it for a long time. Switching eyes while reading is disastrous.

I actually recently had a surgery (3rd one!) to correct it. For *one day*, my brain actually fused images and gave me 3D. I almost cried at the piano. I could see *the whole keyboard and both my hands*! Notes were *present* and *in front of me*! I felt superhuman, like how amazing it is to just be able to see the entire ""forest"" all at once.

Unfortunately, as is the case with strabismus surgeries, it usually doesn't fix your vision, it just makes you a little more cosmetically ordinary.

While strabismus is a hurdle, it doesn't stop me, and I did learn some coping mechanisms:

- I've learned more and more to play without focusing on both my hands. I've relied on physical touch and tactile awareness more than visual input for my right hand. I don't know why I always focus on my left hand and keep my right hand out-of-field, but playing melodies blind has always been easier than hunting for harmonies blind.

- I've had to accelerate learning to read without looking at my hands. I'm not all the way there but it's basically a necessity.

- I've learned to try to reduce looking back and forth between keyboard and sheets, to avoid lots of ""world shifting"".

I'm curious if anybody else here has strabismus and how it affects your piano playing!",1649964223

Everything was practically perfect: passages I often struggled with were flowing out without issue, I was playing slightly faster than I normally do but maintained the precision and flow of my slower performances. Just a great night of practice.

And suddenly in the middle of my last song I realized my heart was going gangbusters. After the song was over I put on my Apple Watch to measure my heart rate. I know it‚Äôs not the most accurate device but it‚Äôs all I have. My initial heart rate was almost 170. It took over an hour of no playing, relaxing in bed, for it to drop under 130, and another hour or more for it to approach normal.

I‚Äôve been taking an anthropology and medicine course at my university, where I was exposed to the Quantitative Self movement - people using technology and data science to track their own health. I think I am going to start tracking my heart rate while I play and see what, if anything, I can learn from it. I‚Äôd love to know if anyone else notices increased heart rate while playing, and how they experience their body while they are engaged in music playing in general.

49,piano,My daughter is into music. What can I do to help her develop her talent?,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter is 16 years old, and it‚Äôs time to think about the future. When she was a bit younger, she signed up for the acoustic guitar classes in her school. My little girl was really lucky because many students wanted to go there and had a limited number of paces. Now, she is doing a pretty good job in this field.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, she also signed up for choir at her school. She says it helps her to develop her voice. As far as I remember, someone suggested this to build confidence. Well, she is into music, but she was a bit shy. I remember her struggling to speak out loud in her class. Whenever the teacher talked to her, she was mumbling something unclearly. Of course, she shared this problem with us, and she said she was embarrassed by her opinion. We talked about it, and later she found the technique of singing from somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, she has become really into music. When she comes from her classes, she can play for a couple of hours. She even started composing her own music and shares it with her friends. Like any parent, I believe that my daughter is talented. I see her future in a slightly different field. But if she loves music, then why not? I believe that her skills will be helpful for someone in the future. Perhaps she can find something in this field.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I don‚Äôt wanna bury her talent. She is free to do whatever she likes, as long as she is safe. If she likes music and hates since, why should I force her? Still, as a parent, I want to do something to help her out. For instance, recently I found this service ‚Äî [music pr](https://www.amworldgroup.com/music-pr). Besides, I‚Äôm thinking about whether I can upload her songs to iTunes or SoundCloud? Perhaps, you know even better some platforms where I can help her.

97,piano,Difference between Yamaha SCLP-7450 and CLP-745?,"I‚Äôm in the market for a new electric piano as I feel like my current one does not have the feel, tone, or dynamic range that I would like. I happen to be in Japan for work and I wandered into a local music store where they have an excellent selection of (Japanese) electric pianos. Spent some time playing on the SCLP-7450 and absolutely fell in love with it. Sounds incredible and the feel is 10x better than my current one. And it looks great to boot. 

My question is, does anyone know what the US equivalent model is? I would assume that it is the CLP-745, but there is a huge price discrepancy between them (231,000JPY or ~$1,840), versus $3,699. Is this right? Obviously there would be customs and shipping involved, assuming I could even buy the Japan model, but that is still a huge difference.",1649890537

1,piano,Help with posture/wrist position/general biomechanics,"Hey y'all, I have played the piano off and on most of my life, but started playing daily again 3 years ago.  I started with a teacher 2 months ago and since then I have been practicing 60-90 minutes a day.  I am solidly intermediate level, but have ambitions of playing at an advanced level.  Current repertoire I'm working on is stuff like Bach 2-part inventions (8 and 13), a few individual movements of Beethoven sonatas (no 1 Allegro, no 8 Adagio) Chopin preludes (4, 20, 22) and nocturnes (1, 20) etc.  

I have started developing wrist pain in the carpal tunnel area.  I know my posture is good, and my wrist and hand position is pretty good.  I have been trying to learn as much as possible about correct wrist/finger/hand position as I can.  Would y'all please add to any of this and or correct any misconceptions I might have?

&amp;#x200B;

* Correct posture is back/spine straight without slouching.
* Shoulders/elbows/forearms/wrists should be in a 90 degree angle.
* Wrists should be above the keys
* Fingers should be in a natural, curved position.
* Tension is to be avoided, muscles should be relaxed from the neck through the shoulders, into the forearms and wrists.  Wrists most especially should be relaxed and without tension.
* Forearms should move rather than wrists

I would love to get general advice or be pointed to resources about correct biomechanics.  I am truly passionate about piano and want to enjoy playing for the rest of life, and also to excel at it.

Thanks guys,

Just sharing my story, and any input is great.   
I am a beginner not just to piano, but to music in general. I started at the end of February, and have been mostly practicing about 3 hours a week. I am 36 so not naive enough to think I have a future as a concert pianist, but confident enough to know that if I do this for 5-10 years, I will likely be good enough to enjoy playing my favorite pieces at home, and maybe even teach my son if he shows interest.   
One huge issue I am facing is that I am pretty directionless with my practices. I have been mostly finding random lessons on YouTube (Pianote, and Jazzer Lee) and also got the Alfred adult book. (Not a big fan)   
I have focused my practices on a few things.   
1. Reading notes   
2. Playing Scales C-C right left and both hands (Both hands super challenging still, but getting easier)   
3. Playing Chords, mostly playing 3rds and working on keeping the shape of my hands.   
4. Started some Arpeggios but 2 handed is still very challenging.   


I am excited that I have my first lesson with a professional tomorrow, so it will be nice to sit down with someone, see exactly where I am, and start practicing with more purpose and direction.",1649815302
52,piano,How do I best use my practice time?,"I have a lot of time on my hands and I want to start taking my instrument seriously. There's a lot I want to cover, but I'm at a loss as to how much time I should spend on things, and how best to craft a balanced practice schedule. 

My goal is to work up to getting four hours of meaningful practice every day, obviously taking a couple 10-15 minute breaks during. I have the time of day and that's how I want to use it. But what do I practice? How do I know when to move on? Basically, how do I craft some sort of curriculum for myself? 

For example, my scales and arpeggios always need work, but I could easily spend a whole week just doing scales and arpeggios. I could probably spend many days on just one scale. It would be dull and probably inefficient but there's always room to improve so I don't know when to cut myself off. What if while practicing my scales, I find I'm struggling a lot more than I expected to, and it takes me significantly longer and more effort to finish. Do I let my scales practice time eat into the rest of my time? Do I cut out some of the scales to focus on ones I struggle with more? 

I know this sounds stupid and like it doesn't matter, but these seemingly trivial hangups completely paralyze me and I end up not doing anything at all. I'm the type of person who NEEDS a rigid structure to follow and conform to, something to anchor me that I can strive for. It's the only way I can make this a real commitment and a healthy habit. 

Things I'd like to practice every day if I'm able include scales and arpeggios, sightreading, improvisation and composition, and naturally I feel I should be working on pieces as well. With all this in mind, can anybody recommend me some sort of reasonable practice schedule? It doesn't have to be perfect - I'll likely make adjustments down the line. What's important now is that I have something I can stick to. Thank you in advance!",1649815114
53,piano,some questions for anyone who's played the Rach 3 ossia cadenza.,"Hi guys, currently working on this and the first two pages are reasonable, seems like for the most part this has been written pianistically and although it's difficult (notoriously so) it's great fun to play and gorgeously intricate. 

Having quite a bit of difficulty with the Presto specifically. The way I've broken this up is by hand position, this is essentially a huge descending fully diminished scale with a ton of color. There's position one which is the first 1.5 bars, switches briefly to a second position at the end of the 2nd bar of the presto, then to a third position with F, A, C# in the LH, the middle note of the chord descending, and then interspersed with the broader descending diminished outline in the octaves in the LH. This is where I'm getting majorly hung up. I can see how the rest of the piece will come together but I am not at all seeing how this is meant to flow from LH octaves to the chords with any reasonable degree of accuracy. I've tried a range of different fingerings without any success. Watching pianists play this on YT seems to be a double-edged sword; anyone playing it slowly enough to see what's going on seems to have made poor fingering choices, and anyone playing it accurately and quickly is moving to fast to see what the positioning is. 

If anyone here has played this and has some advice on how to tackle this specific position change while retaining accuracy, I would love to hear you on it. Thanks guys! Cheers, -Scott",1649814691

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm in my late 20s and want to ‚Äúre‚Äù-learn the piano. My ultimate goals would be: reading sheet music, playing current trendy songs, some classical music, improvisation/playing by ear.


Background:
I always loved piano. When I was in middle/high school I could not afford lessons, so I ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù myself some songs- basically I was watching youtube vids and memorizing finger positions/sounds to play some songs. I was not consistent in playing daily, maybe played a span of a few months in total.

Fast forward today- I finished school, have a job. I want to get back into piano and really learn it so I can enjoy making music and be good at it. I want to be consistent with learning again and considering continuing self-teaching the real way (going back to basics of sheet reading, chords, etc) vs in-person lessons. I want help from reddit deciding if I should just go straight to lessons.

My thoughts/concerns on online videos/self-teaching vs in-person lessons:

I recently signed up for Pianote online and enjoy it for learning basic foundations. I also like how freeing and flexible it is to learn on my own. I‚Äôm afraid if I do lessons that it feels like a chore and I might lose motivation because I will stop enjoying having fun with the piano. On the flip side I‚Äôm aware a good teacher helps point out poor posture/technique, theory, etc. Should I self teach for a bit and wait toll I plateau before switching? I feel like I‚Äôm a natural learner and motivated to practice daily. I just don‚Äôt want to disservice myself by not taking lessons right away and at the same time not lose interest by doing lessons. Not to mention lessons aren‚Äôt cheap and my budget is a little tight but I can probably make room for lessons. Sorry just blurring out all my thoughts lol.

60,piano,"Help for digital piano gift (NP-32, P-85, SP-320)","Hi! I'm looking to buy a digital piano for my girlfriend, she used to play a bit when she was a child and she'd like to start again as a complete beginner.

Myself I don't have any knowledge about pianos, so after doing some research and checking availability in my country I found the below options for my budget. Fyi I'm not looking to spend much since this should be only temporary for starting to play again, if she will get into it we will look at some premium options in the future.

- Yamaha NP-32 with stand and pedal (sh - 175$)
- Yamaha P-85 with stand and pedal (sh - 285$)
- Thomann SP-320 with stand, pedal, chair, headphones (new - 320$)

As a total noob in this domain, I see that the main difference for a beginner would be the feel of the keys compared to a real piano (some of them are weighted better than others, while other cheap options are not weighted at all as far as I understand).

I have also found some NP-12 for sale, but from what I see this is the cheapest and the worst feeling of the keys from the bunch, so I've removed it from my options, let me know if this is correct. 

From the 3 choices above, what would be the best option? Both second hand options are in very good condition and the price would be an advantage compared to a new Yamaha from same category. 

I see that the NP-32 is the only one with 76 keys vs 88 for the other 2, how much does this matter for a beginner?

Many thanks!",1649803106

I know I'm probably being overly sensitive but just want to see what an experienced player on a digital piano thinks. 

I purchased this second handed from a retailer, and it was previously loaned out for a year. There are a couple of keys that have this sound similar to wood scrubbing against each other? Here's a video: [https://imgur.com/a/HjLHRuK](https://imgur.com/a/HjLHRuK) **And this is one of the other ones that sound more normal on the same piano:** [https://imgur.com/a/x1hY1Fq](https://imgur.com/a/x1hY1Fq)

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal? The one that has the weird sound is situated more to the right. I thought these things usually happen after a few years, not after one year it's been released, even though it's loaned out.

72,piano,"Complete beginner, Kawai ES110 vs Roland FP-10","I would like to know your current opinion on which keyboard would be a better choice for a complete beginner. All threads that I can find, that compare these two models are a few years old.

Both are available to me in Europe at a nearly identical price. 

While the Kawai ES110 is the older model, the good about it is that it comes included with a quality pedal, much higher polyphony (192 compared to Rolands 96), and has great piano sound, but I have found reviews, where many complain about bad build quality and loud action. Also, the main way to connect to a PC is through Bluetooth MIDI, but to connect it with a cable, one needs to buy an additional USB to MIDI cable.

Roland FP-10 (which is still available to me in Europe) comes with a very basic ON/OFF pedal, that will need to be upgraded down the line, and has, what is described as the best action at this price point with PHA-4 Standard, and can be connected to a PC easily with a USB cable. But there are many complaints online over Roland clicky keys (which seem to appear everywhere where PHA-4 is used) and very heavy action.

The sound quality of both can be heard in this comparison from Merriam Music (the tested Roland is FP-30, the older model, before the release of FP-30X, and quite similar to the FP-10):

11,piano,Played in my first ever concert today! Here's how it went.,"I'm 19 and have been learning piano for about a year and a half (only had a teacher since last December), the piano school I go to does a big concert twice a year for all the students, my teacher wanted me to play in it so I did even though I wasn't completely sure about it.

Before today I'd only really played infront of family members or in music stores, I actually spent quite a lot of time in Yamaha London a few weeks ago and was asked to play multiple times for people who were looking to buy their first piano and received lots of compliments which really upped my confidence for this concert.

My perfomance was in the 2nd half of the concert, the ordering was pretty weird, it was pretty much easiest music first and hardest music last, not sure if this is standard or not but it was very helpful since I felt like my music was ""better"" than the people before me, so nobody was having to play after someone better than them.

Before I was called up I was feeling pretty calm, I wasn't nervous or anything because I had spent the past 3 months practising every day for this and felt like it'd go fine, but all of that completely fell apart the second I stepped on the stage, my whole body was shaking.

For some reason I was the only one in the concert of about 30 students playing more than one piece so that was quite a bit of pressure.

The first piece I did was ""Peaceful Days"" from the game Chrono Trigger as a 2-piano duet with my teacher, I was starting it then he'd do his solo half way through and we'd both finish together. I started playing and it was going kind of well until about 30 seconds in I completely forgot how to play it and had to stop, I told my teacher I needed to restart and he said okay, I took a few seconds to calm down and started again.

After that, I played the entire piece perfectly with no mistakes, **somehow messing up at the start calmed me down a lot** because nothing really happened, it was just what felt like a few seconds of silence and back to playing.

My 2nd piece was ""Aerith's Theme"" from Final Fantasy VII and I was doing that one solo, I did this perfectly first try with no mistakes.

I am so proud of myself even after my mistake at the start, I far preferred playing it perfectly in 1 go after 1 restart than making a bunch of pauses during the piece.

The next concert is in November and I am definitely going to do it again.

Also the concert was recorded on video but I'm still waiting for a copy of my performance, I might post the video here if anyone is interested. My parents got a video of me on their phone but I'm not that happy with the quality.",1649720647

* Howard baby grand piano

   * In good condition, needs to be tuned
   * Don't have much info about this one. The woman giving it away says they used to take lessons on it as a kid so I'm taking that as it hasn't really been played in like 25+ years? She's going to look for a serial number later today.
* 1941 Kimball upright that was played a ""decent amount"" 2 years ago
   * Overall in good shape, also needs tuning
   * Small patch of cracked veneer on bottom right corner, seems to be just cosmetic

I'm under the impression that both pianos work fine but need tuning, and I can visit to try them out before making a decision. I'm trying to get more information about the baby grand, but at this point I'm more interested in the Kimball--though I'm worried because it's over 80 years old. When I go over to inspect them, what kinds of things should I look out for? And what questions should I ask about its maintenance?

I have a recital coming up in a few months and I'm looking for another song to perform. I'm already planning to play Bach's Invention No. 4 and Autumn Afternoon (a song from Alfred's Premier Course, book 5).

45,piano,Do I need a classical teacher to learn classical piano?," 

Hey guys, so, I've been looking around my area for piano teachers and music centers to go to since I really want to learn piano. I heavily lean towards the desire to play classical piano. I have found two places near me but here's my dilemma. One music school is heavily kid-centered with arts and crafts and a ""Pets Welcome"" policy. Kind of unprofessional if you are not a child (I'm 17). But here's the thing, they have two really good teachers there that look like they focus on classical piano. ( I saw some videos of them playing). So, the other school is a music academy that is a sister company to a record label. I can't find anything out about their teachers but it does say students can choose to go down the more traditional route of piano vs pop piano which focuses more on chords (their words not mine). But this place seems overall more professional I'm just not sure if they have teachers who will teach classical (since it seems more focused on like aspiring music artists of this day and age). Any advice or experience you guys have had with teachers? Should I stop worrying about whether or not they will teach classical pieces? Thank you in advance for any responses!",1649689794

At the time, I didn't have a lot of money to spend on hobbies, so after some research I opted out for Casio CDP-135, which to this day served me well. However, there are a few things that I've grown to be quite annoyed at (some of which are listed in the FAQ in this sub) and given that I practice 1-2 hours a day - I'd like to spend that time being mad at myself for not playing well rather than the instrument (I take lessons so I have experience playing on a better keyboard). Some of these things are: 

1. The clicking sound of the keys 
2. Poor sound when using headphones 
3. Keyboard action 
4. Sensitivity 

Now, I know it hasn't been too long since I started playing, however I am approaching a point where I seriously wonder whether it's time to upgrade to a better digital keyboard. That being said, before I make that call I wanted to ask your opinion. Is it worth for someone with less than 2 years of experience to upgrade from an entry-level piano? Or are the shortcoming of my current instrument not enough to warrant such purchase? Keen to hear your thoughts.

\- [Hands - Jewel Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ-xlDy2B64) (around grade 6 level)

I noticed that I've been improving drastically lately, compared to the past. Note that I haven't been seeing a tutor for 5 years, and took a looong break of 3 years. I started playing the piano again about 2 years ago, it happened really spontaneously. And I still play it frequently to this day.

I started composing my own pieces, or easily playing by ear right after I listen to a song-- but my parents never seem to care about that. They used to watch me and praise me sometimes, back when I was a kid. I felt successful and recognized. It motivated me to do better.

But right now, even when I play complex and fast pieces, no one seems to care. Even when I've improved so much. I don't know if it's just me being an attention seeker, but... When I post a tiny bit of my performance online, people seem to like it, and they say *something.* But, well, my parents don't. They never do.

They find it okay to barge into my room when I'm fully focused on playing the piano, tell me something completely unrelated, disrupt my whole thing, and not even say anything about the piece I've been practicing for weeks to improve. I feel disrespected, neglected.

26,piano,My acoustic piano gets gradually louder due to much / intensive playing - Should I get an alternative?,"Hey, as I tried to convey with my title, I have a really desperate issue with my piano. To recapitulate the problem from the beginning: I have an older acoustic piano (50+ years) which was restored for 1000‚Ç¨+ a few years ago - What I want to say by that: It's a really great instrument in a generally perfect shape, so I don't want to ""blame"" the piano for it. Also the hammer heads where completely exchanged for new ones at that time, which may be important to know for this issue. 

However, since about 8 months ago I really got into playing way more than before. Meaning it can easily go 2 hours - every day. In addition to that, I tend to play increasingly intense songs. To give you an example, I recently play more and more Theishter arrangements like this one (https://youtu.be/gnTtrwzjJSo, check from about 4:00) which can be really intensive. Of course, I already went down a little in volume etc. because I know that It could hurt the piano in long term. Nonetheless: These songs need a bit of intensity and much practice. 

To come to a point: My Piano gets increasingly louder, especially the higher notes from c'' upwards (idk, if this is the correct term in English) to a point where some notes start ringing in the ear. To face this problem I let the Piano get intonated (meaning hammer filing and other processes to make the sound softer) by a professional about two to three months ago. Now it already starts ringing again. Not to a point where its unplayable but it's just getting unpleasant when you want to play for a longer time or family members using the same room. 

Now I thought about switching to an alternative, at least for most of the training, to safe my piano and have a more balanced sound. Does this idea make sense? Which alternative do you suggest with a similar playing feeling? In a long term I thought about investing in a grand piano (eg. Yamaha C2), of course also for other reasons - do grand pianos like this endure more intensive playing without getting loud / shrill?

PS: Sorry, this got longer than intended. Hopefully one of you read through this and may have an idea :) Thanks in forward for reading already!",1649585243

The E5 and the F5 keys both have high-pitched feedback in the background, and the F5 produces a pop sound in the speakers. Though the pop sound doesn't appear when I press it softly, the feedback in both keys appears only when pressed hard. It also occurs when I'm wearing headphones.

First and foremost I've never had any mental health issues before and my life has always been pretty easy going and not stressful.  But it started a few weeks ago when I was playing for my professor. I know this piece pretty well and I thought it would go well, and it was terrible to the point i almost wanted to cry. I felt like that all that work was being thrown out the window and I was shit again. I held it together and went to the practice room and had somewhat of a breakdown. My hands got really shaky, my pulse started to race and i just started crying. the reason that this was weird is because im used to doing hard pieces and not playing perfectly for a teacher. I know this could be due to stress with college and taking so many classes but I've never had an experience where I shut down like that before and it was pretty terrifying. I talked to a close friend and he mentioned that it could be due to getting to attached to how I feel about the piece. I've played it for others and it was a good performance but I was pissed because it didn't play how I wanted/needed to. Im more at a lost end because its started to affect how I preform even a few weeks later, because I about lost it on stage.  I've also had a couple more little meltdowns in practice rooms again.

I have a question and thought maybe you guys could help me out.  
I d like to start learning Moonlight Sonata 3rd Movement and/or Fantaisie Impromptu and would like to ask if you think if it is possible that I can achieve it. Since I had to stop taking piano lessons I have no piano teacher atm which could ""help me out"" with this question. Maybe some background information about me:

I started to play keyboard when I was 8 Years old, switched to the piano when I was 16 played for 4 years and then i had to take a ""break""  (have not learned any new pieces during this time but still played some old ones on regular basis) due to my studies for arround 4 years. I then started to learn new pieces about 8 months ago. I guess also important to mention is, that i have never played any classical piano piece before. 

Maybe some references what I¬¥ m capable of playing (technicly i can play those correct, with i would say decent dynamic but not as ""dynamic"" as the dude in the video, otherwise i would be a professional too i guess):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE0y8MHqT-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE0y8MHqT-g)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wFJhmhNeeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wFJhmhNeeg)

I know that those pieces are totally different from the two pieces I would like to learn now, but maybe it is possible based on the two songs to get an idea of how ""technically skilled"" I am.

I hope this is the right place for my question, if not i would like to apologize in advance.

Looking forward to your answers :)

22,piano,Learning easy pieces?,"So I'm ""good"" at the piano, I have my grades 1-8, 2/3 diplomas, hopefully will do the last one at some point, but my repetoire pool is really small. I'm trying to learn a bunch of concert staples that aren't too difficult for concerts and auditions and stuff, and one weird thing I've noticed is, my sight reading isn't good enough to play it straight off the score, but I'm sort of finding it difficult to learn the pieces because mechanically, I can do all the stuff the pieces are asking no problem. It's like, there's no super tricky stuff that I have to practise a ton or watch out for that helps the memorisation and learning process.

30,piano,Seasoned pianist looking for realistic digital piano,"My background of piano playing is 10+ years of playing, then just on-and-off leisure playing for the past few years. I want one a realistic digital piano in my room so I can play at any time I want, without disturbing others at night.  

(The U3 is downstairs in the living room. FYI Yamaha's have a light, non-mushy, key action compared to playing other acoustic pianos, but I wanted a digital that didn't sound and feel artificial. So when I mention that a keyboard feels too light, I mean it doesn't feel like playing on a real piano.)

Today I went to the physical stores to check out digital pianos because I remember enjoying one of the Roland's around 5 years ago and wanted to confirm what model that I really enjoyed before I actually went out and considered purchasing one. 

The first store had lower end Roland's, plus a Roland GP607 (tho I found the keys too light) and then the rest were Yamaha/Casio. Out of all the pianos there (including Yamaha CLP775, N2) I enjoyed the sound and key actions on the CLP785 and the N1X the most. N1X coming on top but the price tag was quite steep at 9k CAD compared to the 785's 5k. (imo the N1X sounded better than the N2 with the new sampling)

The second store had a variety of Dexibell's (never heard of this brand, looks very technologically advanced but found the keys too light and sound was ok to my taste) and Roland's (LX, HP, Kiyola KF10).  

The HP704 was the feeling and sound I remember, and would still be my number 1 pick after all the testing I did today. LX series, although supposedly more premium, didn't strike me as anything special, if anything, worse than the 704 because the keys felt artificial with less weight, sound-wise quite similar.  Then I encountered the Roland Kiyola KF10, the keys felt *almost* the same as the 704, but maybe with slightly quicker key recovery (was able to 3,2,1 the same note easier and more consistently). Then I read online that all the high end Roland's use all the same PHA-50 key action, so is this placebo or quality control in effect?

TL;DR Current options are the Roland's (HP704/KF10 top choice), Yamaha CL 785, (N1X probably out of budget, high end Roland seems to be cheaper for the same sound feel/quality at ~$4k). Any additional info or suggestions would be wonderful.",1649319051

Hi guys, I have my audition in a few days and I'm very nervous because I wouldn't be able to attend it without a big scholarship. I am a vocalist and pianist, but I have more experience on piano.
I want to know experiences of pianists who got a good scholarship at the audition.
Not relevant but what song did you play? 
Also, what do you think helped you get that kind of scholarship? I mean, do you think it was the song you played, or maybe you were extremely good at sight reading and ear training, or maybe it was the interview?  I've read that even though the piano is not one of the most unique instruments in the world that someone can play, they would have a better chance of getting a big scholarship than a vocalist or guitarist (NO offense by the way) or well it would be less difficult. is that true? Again, I am also a singer but I have been told that Berklee has quite a few singers and guitar players so the level of competitiveness in those instruments is higher.

Although I regret quitting now, they were still valuable since I learned how to: read music , basic music theory, how I shoud practice, play with good form, etc.

Since then I have been playing on and off without a teacher but I have been really consistent for the last year and a half, practicing about 1hr per day. I mostly just follow the RCM syllabus. I try to get through 1 RCM level 8 piece per week, and occasionally play some lower level stuff as well for fun. My current goals are to play pieces from one RCM level for about a year and move on the next level after a year's time, and I would like to be able to play advanced works of Debussy, Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff later on.

Although I feel I am still progressing at a good pace on my own, I have been wondering about getting lessons lately, since I discovered that there is a reputable teacher near me. I don't question I would learn faster with a teacher, what I am wondering  is if the added value if worth the 100$/month for lessons, and if I would even be able to reach advanced level repertoire on my own.",1649271286

For context, I had formal piano lessons for about 10 years as a kid and through my teacher did the board exams up to Grade 6, after which I stopped formal lessons.

Almost a decade on, I still play piano for fun but I've been thinking more and more about finishing the rest of the board exams (Grade 7 and 8) so I can feel like I have accomplished an achievement. Board exams typically consist of technical component (scales etc.), list pieces, aural, sight reading and general knowledge.

I am unlikely to go back to formal piano lessons because other commitments would not make it possible to attend regular lessons, but I have enough time in the week to dedicate to a couple of solid hours of piano practice.

So my question is, would I be setting myself up to fail trying to prepare for board exams on my own without formal guidance or have other people managed to do this on their own? I have the syllabus and have regularly taught myself pieces over the last decade. Grateful for any advice.",1649250657

96,piano,Advice from a piano technician to pianists,"I have noticed a trend that seems to plague many pianists; mainly, that they play with too much force. This puts a lot of stress on the piano, reducing its lifespan, throwing it out of tune more quickly, and reducing dynamic clarity when playing. It also puts a pianist at greater risk of hand injury and damaging their hearing, all of which impedes their progress as musicians.

Instead of giving a piano more when playing, try taking away more so that your ideas will stand out on their own. It is important to treat every instrument gently and with respect. Every piano has different limits, and it takes careful feeling/listening to understand those limits and play within them. Sensitivity is the very foundation of music.",1649234657

17,piano,multi-instrumentalist????,"  

Hi, I'm 18 years old and last year I decided to start embracing my love for music and start playing electric guitar. Still my love doesn‚Äôt stop there, and I've always dreamt of being a multi-instrumentalist. I was now thinking of picking up the piano since I've been playing guitar for a year. What I wanted to ask really is if I'll ever be able to become a proficient player in both guitar and piano, since I started at a relatively old age, and don‚Äôt have unlimited time to put on these instruments, having a limit of half an hour for each instrument per day. I don‚Äôt think I'll be able to play stuff anytime soon but even in 10 years will I be able to play all the hard stuff like moonlight sonata? If so, what stuff should I use to practice, I've searched on YouTube but most of the stuff I find is from guys recycling the same stuff to get views, not really helpful and unable to understand what to do next. I'm sorry for my ramblings and this probably isn‚Äôt the best subreddit to ask but I didn‚Äôt find a multi-instrumentalist one, thank for any help in advance, and I hope whoever reads this has a good day :).",1649197934

Usually I avoid the una corda completely, but combined with the sustain it produces a very soft sound which doesn't seem inappropriate.",1649188422
26,piano,Rachmaninoff's 18th variation (Loveridge),"So I recently started attempting to learn this piece, I got this arrangement and a more simple one (in a different key, ugh), and clearly this is the superior choice, the voicings are much more complete and it's much more technically difficult as well.

BUT, I'm having a lot of problems with some of the choices here, and questions about why someone would choose to arrange it in this way:

There are multiple spots that are completely unplayable as written, and I'm really confused as to why someone would make that choice in what is titled ""transcribed for piano solo.""  

Some of these are just too much reach, I mean my hand span is only about 8"" which I realize is not enough, but even so, we have in the 22nd measure a low Bb to a Db above middle C - more than a two octave reach - without any notation that it should be arpeggiated, and then a full octave in the right hand starting on Gb above middle C, so reaching that top Eb on the bass clef is no simple feat either.

Additionally, there is at least one place where the same note is shown being played at the same time in both clefs, coming in on the third triplet in the bass clef and on the final 16th note (so just after the triplet) in the treble clef.

Finally, there is at least one place where the music, for some reason, changes a note played in the treble clef to a frustrating cross-over in the bass clef even though it was just played with the right hand and could be simply played again, with a single note in the bass clef instead.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure I can struggle through this, but WHY would someone choose to arrange a piece - purportedly FOR solo piano - in this way?  And I'm sure it's some theory answer I don't understand, but at some point isn't it part of the job to arrange a piece so that it's actually playable without making adjustments to what's written?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text, this has just been an extremely frustrating piece, I do find errors in a transcription from time to time but this seems intentional and I just do not understand.  Alternately, if someone has a suggestion for a good solo piano arrangement of this piece that avoids these caveats, I would be grateful!",1649187525

39,piano,Looking for piano composer to collaborate on pop/dance track,"Hi,

I'm looking for a piano composer to collaborate with on a house/dance track. I can come up with some ideas that usually need expanding. I've been producing for 6 years, have been featured on Spotify curated playlists and have had a track released on a small label. I've had some minor blog coverage etc. Nothing major I would say I'm intermediate level producer now.

You would need to be able to have access to some sort of software and be able to import wav files and export midi files (e.g. GarageBand on Mac or similar). If the track is strong I can arrange for professional mixing/mastering at my expense and I also work with a regular vocalist. Collaboration would be on a credits and royalty split basis at the point of distribution.

There would be no pressure, would be like a jam back and forth over online maybe a zoom call or whatever works and we would just try one track no big commitment. Just see how it goes, if you are interested in such a project please let me know and maybe send some sample work.

Here is a sample track if you want to check it out to get a feel for the type of sound I'm going for:

48,piano,I'm self learning rocket science and it's easier than teaching myself to play the piano. Specific questions and advice request.,"Hi! I love structure and routes during my learning and practice and I struggle to feel fulfilled with how I practice the piano. I've had a digital piano for a little over a year and the only thing I've done with it so far was playing off of those 'falling tiles' videos. Yeah, I could play something that stands in the vicinity of a song that would sound okay to an untrained ear but.. yeah, I won't even mention why that isn't really learning.

I am very successful in learning engineering by myself. My learning system is very structured and it is very carefully planned out, timed, and measurable. I have been trying to do the same with piano, however, I end up questioning the practice way too much. The difference is that when it comes to engineering, the roadmap is laid out by the book itself, so going page by page, one can be certain that the time they spend doing this (with a few adjustments, of course) is spent effectively.

Learning to play the piano using a book would be lovely, but when I sit down by the piano and open up a book such as Alfred or Faber, I end up reading more than playing. There is information that in order to learn I need to note down, and possibly turn into flashcards. This particular process is absolutely irritating as my piano bench does not at all allow for this process to be effortless, or at least even doable. It's physically draining and time-consuming. 

At this point I am aware of the importance of technique exercises such as scales, arpeggios, maybe even hanon/czerny type of things. I also need to learn the theory. Getting used to and learn to play using sheet music is my main goal.

I'm a busy person and most of my discipline and effort goes into things unrelated to playing the piano. With most of my focus being spent heavily on studies, physical training, various other habits, I would like to streamline the piano learning process as much as possible, by not only removing the confusion on what to practice by developing a route beforehand, but also making it fun and rewarding. That being said, plugging my digital piano to a tablet using a MIDI cable and using apps to learn is great. I am not talking about the magic piano apps or whatever, in fact, I am talking specifically about [this particular website](https://sightreading.training/), which is a sight reading trainer. So far I've greatly enjoyed it, but it becomes problematic when I'm trying to develop an idea of how to progress through it. As you can see it is quite deep, with for example treble clef having variable amount of notes to press at the same time, same for the bass clef, then we've got both clefs together, then triads, sevens, and all of it we can choose to practice in different keys. 

The thing I hate the most is ineffective practice, thus, in order to achieve deliberate training sessions, I would literally pay someone to talk to me about structuring a progression route through this website, as well as through things such as arpeggios and scales. It is when I have an algorithmic learning process that I flourish. When it comes to books, I would love if someone could shed some light on that too, but if you know of a better way of learning to read notation and terminology than method books, perhaps more modern, such as an app, I'd greatly appreciate that too.",1649164387

### Guidelines

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines below and check out all the previous piano jams in the sidebar.

You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. **Please put ""Piano Jam"" post tag or ""[Piano Jam]""  somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for. People have posted without this tag before and it's not the end of the world of course, but it does mean we might miss your submission!**

Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability, but any links are allowed.

* You do not have to complete or perfect pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces. Also, don't be afraid to improvise or write your own ending to a looped piece of video game music, etc.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the /r/piano community.

* For classical pieces ABRSM grade estimate is in brackets - the source of estimation is [piano grade aggregator](http://pianosyllabus.com/default.php)

* You do not have to limit yourself to just one piece, you can submit as many as you like as long as they belong to the list.

* If you have pieces you would like to suggest for future Piano Jams, please use our [suggestion form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5U5DA0OjN1HeaK-5Ue_s92HeZ5ud_2OynMb0WoKt1BPPwrg/viewform).

53,piano,What have you found to be the hardest pieces to memorise?,"For me, I have never failed to memorise a piece if i wanted, however, the most difficult piece probably would have to be Satie Gymnopedie no.1. I can memorise bach fugues pretty easily, and loads of other complicated stuff, but this piece is so repetitive, i often just use the wrong chord in the middle.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, almost all issues memorising a piece is where there is similar material with slight differences within a work, and so i get muddled. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the fact there is nothing technical about the Satie (barring some voicing to get it to sound good) means you also have almost no muscle memory to help you.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably another factor is because it's too easy, you don't want to spend a long time trying to memorise it, so I don't kind of give it too much resistance. I have 19 other pieces i'm trying to memorise and polish up though, so this i don't spend much time on.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, fire away people, just wanted to share my slightly ironic hot take that one of the easiest pieces in the traditional piano repertoire is also one of the hardest to memorise.",1649156650

at the end of second line i see a higher G and i think fast ""this looks too big interval, i need to move hand"" but i have no idea how much since i have no idea where my thumb is and the next note so i just stop playing, and the first of third line!?!?! well that is 100% dark i'm completly lost.  

i see that the piece is in C major so i expect only white keys, this helps because knowing the scale means that you know that you will ""never"" press some keys because they are outside the scale.

if i have to study a piece is not a problem i will take my time at each hand movement and study the new position but on the fly??? i'm lost... and while in this case i would stop at the end of second line the real problem is actually at the circled 2.  

and to be honest also at the beginning of the piece for the same reason but i can look fo like 2-3 sec at my hand before starting to play and i will know which key is under which finger until the next hand movement so in the beginning of the piece is not a problem.

Looking for critique and general advice.,"I took a year of lessons over a decade ago and never learned anything harder than Fur Elise, and even then I never learned to play it well. I've barely played piano since then, but every once in a while I'll attempt to learn something. Recently, I started listening to Bach and began to realize how subpar my playing was, even of pieces that I've played over 100 times. 

One piece I learned a few years ago was Butterfly by Daigo Hanada. 

My performance: https://whyp.it/t/butterfly-ejLNR/

Original: https://youtu.be/PzyrYmpIOzg



I was completely satisfied with my ability to play it when I first learned it, but now I feel like it's really poor. I'm not too concerned with the notes if any are wrong since most of the sheet music I could find wasn't 100% correct, but I'd like to work on making it sound less amateur. 

My next goal was to learn [G Minor Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-ONVkhJVSA), but I'm realizing this is pretty out of reach if I want it to sound decent. Could I get some general advice on working towards this?",1649084039

9,piano,Two Time Signatures: Bach Prelude in D Major BWV 874,"I'm currently learning Bach's Prelude and Fugue in D Major, No. 5 WTC 2, BWV 874. At the beginning of the prelude, there are two time signatures given - cut time (2/2) and a 12/8 time signature.

I found another post on here that helped me understand parts of the timing for this prelude. For example, in certain measures, like mm. 1 and 3, the quavers are to be treated as ""triplets"" or can be counted in 12/8 time.

My immense confusion starts in Measure 5. A post I saw mentioned that the quaver-semiquaver figure in the left hand coincides with the third quaver from the quaver ""triplet"" (marked in the red boxes). It also looks like within the first semiquaver-quaver group, the semiquaver in the dotted quaver-semiquaver figure falls with the 3rd and 4th semiquavers that open the bar (marked in the blue boxes). I'm really not sure how the math works out here. This confusing pattern repeats throughout the prelude and I'm so lost.

Regardless of whether we treat the dotted quaver-semiquaver figure as triplets or as written in 2/2 time, should the semiquaver in the left hand be played *after* the third quaver from the quaver ""triplet"" in the right hand? Am I missing something or not understanding something here? Would appreciate any help!!

But every single post i've seen about starting to self-learn has been so discouraging to me and i imagine others too, 90% of the answers are something along ""get a teacher"" but if that were a possibility, the questions would not be asking specifically about self-learning right?

Whether or not people specified if possible or not, the answer is always to get a teacher, while i've read and been convinced about why people said a teacher would be better, it is simply not an option sometimes.

Some background; i'm a college student living with his parents in a relatively poor country with no money and little time for regular piano lessons, my family is not at all supportive so when i practiced last, i was just playing slow and easy songs on my keyboard plugged into headphones some days that's all.

36,piano,Are used pianos often not good?,"I went to 4 piano stores this weekend researching for my upcoming piano purchase. 

One was a small shop focused on restoring pianos. One was a shop that has a lot of used inventory. I played a lot of (at least 7 each) Yamaha U1s and U3s (mostly from 70s and 80s). I played a YUS1. I played some Kawai uprights.

I didn't think I'd prefer any of them to my digital (MP11). I didn't think any of them were really comparable to the new Yamaha or Kawai uprights.

I've heard people online say that any decent acoustic is better than a digital, but I'd never give up my MP11 for one of the used uprights I played this weekend (unless I no longer had access to electricity). My MP11's touch and tone were superior to all of them.

Did I just get unlucky? Or is it actually tough to get an actually good used acoustic Yamaha or Kawai upright? Or have I been brainwashed by playing my MP11 for the last 5 years?

(I may have other questions later based on my experiences this weekend, so if you think you see a repost from me , it might just be a different question formatted the same way by me)",1649030486

Player Piano - We'd like to add a system to the piano that will allow us to digitally tell the player piano to physically play the piano according to digital files of music.  I don't know what the methods are, who the vendors are, etc.  Can you tell me which brands there are and pros and cons?  Do some only allow their own formats, or do they all allow any MIDI to be played?  How is the device controlled?  Can I use the piano as a controlled instrument in a music system like Garage Band or something more professional?

Recorder - We'd like to be able to record the performance on the piano digitally for later playback.

I have seen with the recent proliferation of various apps for piano learning, there has been a sharp growth of self-taught learners. (which, I think is good, because it gets people to pick an instrument) However, after a point of time, you can rely only so much on an app and need guidance with either
1. Critique/feedback on how well you are playing, technique etc.; how much progress you have made
2. what should be your next steps to better improve your piano playing?

Does anybody know of any platform/website where one can post their video recording and seek detailed critique/feedback from piano teachers (either for a price or free)?

76,piano,CA99 vs CLP785 vs Lx708,"Hi! I'm a classic pianist who played on acoustic upright pianos for 12 years. After I went to university, I realized that it's impossible for me to get an acoustic piano in the bedroom I rented, so I decided to purchase a digital piano. The three pianos I listed in the title seem to be the most premium digital pianos right now in the market, so I would like to here your opinions about these three and see if there's any other options. Here's some points I'm considering.

1. no upper bound of budget (don't be sooooo crazy though, anything under 20k is fine)
2. I need to move every four months, so the movability is a big problem. I will find professional piano moving companies for sure, but the width of my bedroom's door is 88 cm, so it must be thin
3. Must be able to connect to an earphone, since I have 3 roommates.
4. The touching feel needs to be as close to an acoustic piano as possible since I only play classic music.
5. Needs to be reliable.
6. The apparence doesn't matter

So for the three types I listed, I personally don't like Roland because they don't make acoustic pianos. For the other two, people always say that CA99 has a lot of flaws and you need to wait for a long time for CLP785. I would really appreciate if you can give me some more suggestions.",1648996831

84,piano,Alberti bass is putting a damper on my motivation - any tips?,"Hey all - I recently started playing the piano (a month in) and to support my practice I have a teacher come in weekly, where we usually go over a short classical piece to practice some new technique. Most recently I completed an easy arrangement of a German dance by Schubert - really enjoyed this one, could exercise some amount of musicality already with the phrasing.

This week I started on [an arrangement of an Aria](https://imgur.com/a/4cUJoXz) from Don Giovanni. Right hand and left hand individually are easy, but combining the two means for me going so slow as to render the whole piece devoid of much musicality. I feel the Alberti bass should feel natural but I have to constantly look at the score and consequently kill the tempo of the piece (I've heard one should always practice hitting the right notes before focusing on rhythm). So three questions:

1. Any tips on learning the technique faster and making it more 'instinctual' and, down the line, musical?

2. Is there value in learning this specific technique given its applicability to a relatively narrow range of classical-era pieces, or will there be carryover benefits?

3. On a larger level, is this kind of drop in motivation to be expected when practicing piano in the long-term?

He really enjoys playing on this Yamaha and I‚Äôve been looking at purchasing one that is similar. I‚Äôve read through the guides but I‚Äôm still a little confused about what would be a good purchase.

49,piano,How do I convince my family to let me quit the piano?,"This is a bit of a long one, and a tough situation due to cultural tie-ins. But basically, I've been playing the piano for roughly eight years now, but I've never enjoyed it. 

As a child, it was my dream to play the violin, but I wasn't allowed to because ""our family plays the piano, not the violin."" Naturally, I was bitter about this for a number of years before giving up on that dream. I've learned a great deal of piano, and I've passed the RCM level 10 test with a decent score. However, even with all the achievements under my belt, I *just don't enjoy playing.* I don't find it to be interesting, or fun, or anything it's ""supposed to be"", according to my family. Furthermore, my family is Eastern European, and music runs *biiiiig* over there. Quitting isn't a small thing.

Another issue is that my grandmother is my piano teacher. So, even if I were to quit, I would not be saving anyone money. Instead, I'd just be causing problems-- and I don't think I would be forgiven for quitting (supposedly, according to my grandmother, I have ""talent"". My mother also laments about having an expensive instrument in the home, so it'd be a ""waste"" if I didn't play.)

Piano has blocked me from pursuing other things I enjoy-- sports, language learning, and time for myself. Instead of being given a chance to unwind, as soon as I'm out of school I go to play the piano. Then homework. Then piano again. It's consumed my life completely and every time I sit down at the bench, I just beg for my practice time to be over. Piano has mentally destroyed me, but it's become so intertwined with my life that if I quit, I have nothing that sets me apart from other people. 

Anyway, back to the point-- I've never enjoyed the piano, for as long as I've played it. I've had two different teachers, taken multiple RCM tests, and tried all sorts of different practice strategies, but nothing seems to work. I'm honest-to-God over it, but I've never been able to quit. Is there a way to convince my family to let me quit, or do I just power through until I leave for college?",1648931622

56,piano,Practicing with a busy schedule,"Hey there, so I'm a student and work full time and am pretty new to piano, started last year. The past month I haven't been able to get myself to play piano as much as I would want due to either being busy or feeling unmotivated  or too lethargic to get myself to start playing. I also struggle with adhd and combined with a busy schedule it feels sometimes impossible to get myself in the proper mindset to play. Combined with feeling like I haven't been improving because of getting into harder repertoire and my inability to get to playing the piano, it feels that I'm just getting deeper in a rut and getting more and more behind in my lessons and practice and feeling overwhelmed with what to do, which then feeds back into feeling apathetic or unmotivated to play. 

So basically I'm wondering when you guys are struggling with getting to practice with or without a busy schedule, how are you able to get a session in or even start it sometimes? A lot of the times in life it feels like the biggest issue for me is to just get the ball rolling, I'm terrible with procrastination and getting focused and started on a task, sometimes not knowing where to even start. What may be some habits or approaches to practice that may help me with this?",1648926596

I couldn't disagree more with him. This is toxic af. Why would a sane person accept that?

But if what he says is true it wouldn't make much sense for me to pursue a music career. I enjoy playing the piano, Id like to teach it and tour. As a hobby I enjoy singing country music and playing the guitar.

85,piano,My piano teacher left; I need help,"So my piano teacher left, and I have college auditions in 5 months. Tell me my chances of getting into a music college

So the most difficult piece I have finished in it‚Äôs entirety for each category is Bach prelude and fugue in d minor book 1 WTC, Mozart sonata 545, and Rachmaninoff 3/2. Both the fugue and prelude came off pretty easily and the sonata just took careful touch, but I know I can‚Äôt submit these works to colleges. 

Last year I almost completed Chopin‚Äôs 1st ballade but got caught at the coda as I had exams and my first AP exam. I am thinking of learning that again and I would use it as my piece for romantic period. Or should I look into a piece that can prepare me for the coda better, then tackle it?

I‚Äôd keep the prelude and fugue, but what are some recommendations of baroque style for similar/harder difficulty? I think I prefer slow/moderately fast vs a very fast prelude as the prelude of the d minor one gave me some trouble. 

For a piano sonata I was going to go with Beethoven. To give you a better understanding of my Beethoven/sonata experience I had completed Turkish March sonata by Mozart, moonlight 3rd movement, and some of pathetique 1st and 3rd which was not too difficult. I was thinking of opus 2 no 1 for Beethoven, but maybe something a little less played would be better?

I also need an etude from either Chopin, rachmaninoff, debussy, Liszt, or Mussorgsky. I haven‚Äôt started any, and technique wise I‚Äôm good with my wrists. I can play pretty fast l, and my voicing is good. I probably can‚Äôt to anything that involves complex rhythms tho.
 
My main problem is that I might not have a teacher next year and definitely not over the summer and I‚Äôm afraid that my skill will go over the roof. I‚Äôm really nervous, so is there anything I should do now like look for teachers? Btw this is through my school.",1648897770

This, of course, only occurrs when I'm playing with the sustain pedal, as the hammers are pulled off and not touching/blocking the strings. Any idea what it could be?

I now wanna learn how to play it but it's annoying having to unplug it from my PC after watching a video and then plugging it into my piano every time I want to watch a video. I posted this on a forum asking for advice the other day and was told to buy a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and Hosa STP-201 Insert Cable. I bought both of those and before I even tested them with the piano I noticed the headphone audio output on the scarlett sounded like it was under water when I was playing a youtube video, I was using Sony XM4 headphones with an adapter as they were the only headphones I have. I looked online and I think this was because of the microphone on the headphones and I don't know how to disconnect it because there's no buttons on the headphones themselves for that.

&amp;#x200B;

This setup costed me like $250 which is over half of what I paid for the piano and I don't even know if they work (I couldn't get audio out of the piano; extreme noob at hardware just plugged things at random places and expected it to work), should I return these and what do I do instead?

41,piano,Do I have to learn all the pieces of the RCM 1 books ?,"First of all, I am not Canadian and I do not plan to take the exams. I play for myself and do not intend to play piano professionally. I am self taught although I do post videos of myself playing from time to time so that people can tell me what is wrong with my technique (so far everything is mostly ok). 

That being said, I have been playing piano for 15 months and have learned almost all the RCM Prep A and B pieces. Then I spent many months learning the RCM grade 1 pieces (repertoire and etudes), I have learned about 30 of them (out of 53, what is left are the ugly pieces). 

I can sight read a grade 1 piece as long as it's under 60 BPM and only one hand at a time and I've started learning my scales a couple weeks ago. 

When I learn a piece, I first try to sight-read it. Then I memorize each hand separately until I master each hand at the right tempo. Then I play with both my hands together, slowly increasing the tempo. I learn a piece in less than a week now but I continue to perfect it at the same time as I learn a new piece.

Anyway, I'm wondering, do I have to learn all the remaining pieces or can I move to the next level ? I'm not in a hurry but I worry that I might never get anywhere if I learn all the pieces for each level lol. Should I learn only half the pieces ? I don't want to speedrun to level 10 but I don't want to be slow as fuck either",1648804158

I‚Äôm in my 30s and I‚Äôve been practicing with a private teacher for a few years from zero. My previous teacher was super strict and would make a big fuss if I play a wrong note. For any easy practice pieces, if I played anything wrong at the lesson he would let me practice another week until I can play smoothly.
I recently changed to a new teacher due to moving. His style is very different, which I actually like a lot. He focuses more on big pictures, pointing out what I should be practicing and provided more variety of exercises. For example, my previous teacher would let me go through 12 major scales during class and assigned me the same practice if I did one scale wrong. The new teacher will hear one scale and tell me to practice a different way to improve my left hand.
My only concern is, he seems to not to care if I played something wrong, as long as I knew what I did wrong. When I played a jazzy practice piece, I think i did badly cause I was nervous. But he thinks I got the feel of the piece right and should move onto the next piece.

18,piano,Piano purchase questions,"Hi all, I‚Äôm new to this sub and have some questions about a new piano purchase. 

Some background: I am and am not a piano newbie. I was very accomplished at one time and have a degree in piano performance from a prestigious music school. But... I have touched a piano only a handful of times in the last 30 years. At this point it feels like a language I spoke as a kid but haven‚Äôt heard in a long time. It‚Äôs in there, but it‚Äôs deep. 

I find myself lately wanting to play again, and would like to buy a piano. I‚Äôd like an upright with a sensitive action and great tone. I want to feel it. I also don‚Äôt want to break the bank but don‚Äôt mind paying for a quality instrument. What would you look at if you were in the market now?

Second question....digital pianos have come a very, very long way since I was in music. I‚Äôve always been a purist about ‚Äúreal instruments‚Äù with actual wood and felt and strings. I always felt, especially for young learners, that you lose something in the learning of your touch when playing electronic instruments. But I know that today‚Äôs digitals are replicating these things amazingly well. Should I consider these too? I don‚Äôt have much need for silent practice, but it is nice, and my kids might dig it. 

Any tips you all have would be really appreciated. Thanks!",1648715511

I want to learn how to play Piano - I have a lot of motivation, since I am listening to a lot of Jazz and I just love the instrument. I already have some music knowledge since I play the guitar already.

I've stumbled across a Yamaha PF15 and tried to search for comments online (I haven't found anything in this Sub or in the FAQ, so I hope this text post is justified). My current sentiment is that it is an old af e-Piano, which is mostly still loved by people who own it. It should have good weighted 88 keys (if my research is correct) but unfortunately no MIDI (which I don't think I'll need tbh). 

I will mostly try to learn Jazzy stuff. The Piano is offered for 110‚Ç¨.

So - I'd be grateful for any informations! Is it thrash and not worth the money or is it still quite nice to start to learn the instrument? Am I missing something?

I am looking forward to your reply!

78,piano,Choosing digital piano abroad where everything is 1.5-2x the cost,"Hi there,

I'm trying to buy a digital piano out of my country I have a Korg D1 at home, but it's twice the price. The only fully weighted 88 key pianos within a reasonable budget are:

* Casio CDP S100: ¬£530

* Casio CDP S110: ¬£546

* Casio CDP S150: ¬£576

* Casio CDP S160: ¬£591

* Yamaha P45: ¬£657

* Korg B2: ¬£682

* Casio CDP-S350: ¬£713

The most important aspect for me is reasonably realistic action, low latency midi out, and a serviceable sustain pedal. I use VSTs for sound. My girlfriend would like nice speakers and a headphone jack.

I'm leaning towards the Korg B2 at the minute (though it lacks the RH3 keybed of my D1). But maybe I should just save the cash and get the CDP S110 if the action is similar?

Does anyone have experience with them and have advice? (or have any other tips and recommendations about any of the listed models? I know e.g. that the korg can do recording out and not just midi - not a deal breaker for the cdp though)",1648644449

I am finding it increasingly difficult to play faster pieces on this piano and finding that my fourth and fifth fingers of my right hand hurt if I have to hold down a note while playing another voice with my other fingers. In comparison, I played on my relative‚Äôs Casio which is much looser for nearly 4 hours straight and no feelings of pain. My question is, if you‚Äôve owned an sp-500 or tried it, do you think the action is realistic to what you would find on a real grand piano and that it‚Äôs my technique/overwork that‚Äôs causing this? Or do you find the keys very heavy and/or unrealistic?

I was thinking of possibly getting a kawai es920 or ca49, but I‚Äôm really not sure if it‚Äôs worth the $3000 I‚Äôd be paying. Both of those pianos were nice but the action is looser and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs that much of a difference in quality. My relative says my piano has nice action and she‚Äôs had conservatory training since childhood so I want to trust her but I‚Äôm also slightly skeptical as most of her playing was during the Soviet era and I doubt they had the best pianos.

I used to attend physical therapy 2x a week a couple years ago, but in recent years have learned to manage it on my own. Basically, I just make sure to avoid activity that aggravates it and/or stretch very well before and after. The issue I'm running into is that playing piano seems to aggravate my tendonitis more so than really any other activity. I've tried being very diligent with stretching, but even so I'm still having symptoms that don't go away for 1-2 weeks after playing for an hour.

26,piano,Learning through sheet music and synthesia along side each other?,"There's a few really cool songs I want to learn, I've had a teacher for a while now and already making phenomenal progress with learning sheet music, but there's a piece that's far out of my reading range and would like to learn it and probably another one but I've not tried reading the notes or anything yet.

Would it be okay to learn songs through synthesia alongside sheet music or would that be bad?

Personally I do see the issue with synthesia, it doesn't really go into detail and simply shows the notes but not how to play it. But I sometimes feel like I know how to play something just by listening to it a few times, not the notes but just like how the song goes, which parts are slow, which are fast etc.",1648581807

I bought a second hand Williams Allegro II 5+ years ago and just upgraded (at least in brand and cost...) to a Yamaha P125.

The action / keys feel very different which is actually fine and I anticipated. They are much heavier which I expect I'll grow accustomed to. The dynamic range is much easier accomplished a seemingly larger on the P125.

My problem is with the sound quality. Particularly with headphones (the on board speakers actually kinda stunk for the Williams). The Allegro had a really rich and pure sound. It just sounded quite good. And I *think* quite realistic... But not sure on that.

Enter the P125. The onboard speakers sound great. But with headphones, I am really not too impressed. Is this also a matter of adjustment like the action? I think I hear artifacts in the sound (imperfections). I added (and tweaked, and tweaked) the reverb to try and add some richness, but it doesn't sound great...

I don't know the sample process for either brand (recorded? synth?) but does anyone happen to have experience with Williams and can shed light on this? I have half a mind to return the P125 and just get a nicer model of the Williams. I guess I'm wondering how much I should be trusting my ears versus what I read online about reputable brands.

42,piano,Seeking advice on a piano for my 7 year old/price check on a used digital,"Hello piano reddit! I know nothing about pianos but my 7 year old is taken with them. If we go somewhere that has a piano he's on it constantly. I'm going to get him lessons and seeking advise on what to get for our home. I'm a full custody single mom on a tight budget. We have access to a free keyboard (not weighted), and there are a number of free upright pianos available in my area, however, after the cost of moving it and tuning it, I could get a used digital piano with weighted keys for a similar price. There is one for sale locally on Facebook called the Yamaha P60 and they're asking $400 but open to offers. The other local one is Technics SX-P30 with an amp for $450. Are these good prices? I love the sound of an acoustic piano and think that's best but the reason I'm favoring the possibility of a digital one is that we live in a townhouse with neighbors attached to both sides, and it's possible we will move sometime this year, which would be an even bigger expense with trying to find a new home for the piano. Is it ok to learn on a digital piano? What about the free keyboard with unweighted keys to start? is that a bad idea? any links or recommendations for well priced DPs would be great. It seems like the Yamaha P60 has good reviews but it's old and I'm wondering if it's overpriced. thanks!",1648570534

The style of music I'm playing sometimes requires synthesizers and so I think this would allow me to switch between synths and traditional piano sounds the easiest while being able to plug into a PA system. 

I have seen some options recommended here and elsewhere for a few options but mostly aimed at beginners. I currently have a Yamaha P-115 which is decent but not very portable due to its weight and I don't really find myself using its full range for the style of music I'm playing. I don't necessarily need weighted keys, but having played a lot of keyboards I know the quality of non-weighted keys can vary greatly among cheaper brands. Ideally I'm looking for something light weight that doesn't sacrifice too much in dynamics but I can adjust my playing as long as the velocity sensitivity is decent.

43,piano,Pieces that should be easy but are only hard because the composer doesn't tell you d***,"This isn't about fast passages of notes, or insane skill level requirements. This is about pieces that are theoretically easy.

Debussy Images 1 mvmt 3. I don't speak French, nor Quebec French. But Google translate doesn't help make ""la m.d. en valeur sur la m.g."" make any more sense when trying to figure out if Debussy wants the treble staff to be right hand or some odd configuration of passing notes back forth between the hands. Along with the sparse ""sopra"" directions which tell you to switch hands may as well not exist.

60,piano,Need help selecting college audition piece(s) ~~~~~ CLASSICAL MUSIC ~~~~~,"Hello everyone! this question is directed towards the classically-minded folks here. I am in dire need of help for selecting college audition pieces. I guess I need three pieces between baroque, classical sonata, and romanticism periods. I have 5, maybe 6 months? probably less time in practice bc of AP exams (4, yay!) and classes, but I can usually put in 4 hours of practice on a good day. My summer is not jammed at all so I am planning on practicing a lot then as well. I also need to practice scales; any tips would be greatly appreciated. Also, if any of you kind pianists did audition for a music program in the classical sense, what did you submit?

I have the most experience in romanticism, as I am working on Nocturne 27 2 and have great progress on ballade 1. However, I was forced to abandon the ballade so I could get a rach prelude together for a concert (hint: dun dun DUN). I had pretty much everything at ok besides the coda, but after playing it recently it is not in good shape. I thought it might be a good idea to pick a slightly smaller project; what about ballade 3/fantasie f minor? I am pretty good with voicing after rach prelude, and I was messing with the fantasie and it didnt sound all that bad sight reading until 3rd page idk whats going on there (after the doppio section). I haven't looked at ballade 3 yet, but I love listening to it all the time. I'm pretty bad at 4/3 tho, so it might not work out. I hope my problems with poly go away after I finish 27 2 (I also completed arabesque 1).  Notable completed repertoire: Rach 3/2 + Debussy Arabesque + Chopin 9/2 (not very but im putting it for what its worth)

My baroque experience is bach invention no 8 f maj and P&amp;F d minor book 1. I am looking at another prelude and fugue by Bach because that seems to make a lot of sense to me. Technique wise I have none to go off picking another comp, but I think I can handle anything in the mid range pretty well. I looked at some rankings on piano street; are they to be trusted? half of the lot have some pretty dog opinions (argument about the barcolle being below 2nd ballade in difficulty made me die inside). My teacher told me to consider keeping this P&amp;F to let me concentrate more on the sonata/romanticism.

like I said bach PF BWV 851 d minor WTC 1/invention 8 in f major

Pretty little sonata experience besides pathetique sonata 1 &amp; 3 and moonlight 3. completed mozart 545 ofc. Was interested in Op 2 no 1 beethoven, but Ive heard its also kinda overplayed so probably not. I think my ability to play beethoven is below mozart; maybe pieces around 5-6henle? Is that high enough?

  
Also, I don't have an etude :/. In a perfect world my favorite etude is 25/1, but thats probably not possible to learn with everything; can my etude be my romanticism piece? or is the etude a separate requirement?

I wanted to buy a keyboard, that also works as midi in a daw.
Im a complete beginner to piano/keys and wanted to learn it as a second instrument/accompaniment and to help me learn theory.

After several hours of research i found several ones with 61keys and some effects im interested in. But since ive seen a lot of people recommending the full 88 keys, im leaning towards a compromise which is this [Yamaha PSR-EW425](https://www.thomann.de/de/yamaha_psr_ew425.htm) with 76 keys. Which is also at the top end of my budget.

For info, i wanna learn some easier classical pieces, maybe some jazz/blues, stuff like ""flower dance"" and am unsure if 76 keys are sufficient for my beginner years.

Suggestions are welcome.
Thank you in advance!",1648401271

First I pick a song. It‚Äôs usually just a piano cover of songs I like. Then I find the synthesia video for it. Then I find a synthesia version of the song on YouTube. Then I take a sharpie and mark every key on my instrument that the song uses: little notes, arrows, little marks, bigger marks for keys that are used the most, writing shit like ‚Äúchord 1‚Äù and ‚Äúchord 2,‚Äù etc etc etc. Then I just watch the synthesia video and play along using my marked keyboard or piano or whatever I‚Äôm using at the moment.

A few years ago I made myself a little website ""[pianos.pub](https://pianos.pub/)"" that catalogs public piano locations for me so when I get to a new city I can find a piano. I travel a lot and often looking forward to de-stressing my traveling with playing piano which I always sorely miss.

Usually I find a piano and can go to play and also to listen to others play. Despite the cliche, I like when people use the pianos to flex on the world (maybe I'm guilty of this once or twice) and I've had a lot of really meaningful interactions with other people that like to play on them.

So anyways, I thought I'd share this website. Its not the greatest since I'm not a professional coder or anything, but it works pretty well for me.

I've been working on La Campanella, which I know is a fairly popular piece on this subreddit. I can muddle through the piece at a slow-ish pace but I can now play the first few pages up to speed. I thought I'd share a few of my fingerings in case anyone is interested :)

This section here in measures 34-37 kicked my ass - originally I played the chords in this second measure here with my right hand, using alternating 1-5, 2-4 fingerings. I realized I could take the bottom notes with my left hand and it made things so much better.

https://preview.redd.it/d2bqxjtc6tp81.jpg?width=951&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9ddd4211e25c0c9bd7e8897e6ea514f9f62d2a3

This one from measures 22-27 is pretty obvious in hindsight. When I was playing as written I was having trouble jumping from the lower note to the high note; then I realized I could just take that low note with my left hand.

https://preview.redd.it/9jabvvno6tp81.jpg?width=940&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f01c1946cbebb835413e79e360b75eee60a7d8e

This part from measures 41-42  was also giving me wicked hand strain trying to jump all those octaves, but I just took the low notes with my left hand again, which I saw in a performance by Andre Watts :)

53,piano,I'm self taught and thinking of theory / playing in different keys other than C Major/relative minor is really hard for me...,"I've been using C major / A minor and equivalent Modes in these keys for years. I learned the how to borrow from pararell minor and secondary dominent movements / modal interchange with them... Hitting stuff like E7, or Dmajor, or playing D Dorian. I just know how it works and relates to other keys in that scale.

I'm so familiar with the key's and which chords / keys to hit for certain sounds, that I can't think of trying to compose or play or ""think"" in different keys...

All the chords would be different names, and different positions, and the pararell / secondary doms / modal interchange would all be new and different chords. It feels like I'd be learning music all over again from the start...

I don't understand how people can just compose the same in all key signatures, or play in all key signatures? Is there a trick or is it just memorization?

Again, I'm so familiar with working the ""white keys"" as the base and what chords work off of them, and find new keys very confusing since it just changes up what keys/chords to hit for the very same sounds since we're all tuned with equal temperment... I usually transpose all the songs to these keys also. Something plays in E dorian? I'll transpose it to D Dorian and play it (since it ultizes white keys) I can't understand the piece otherwise...

Should I try to progress out of my perfect music garden of using white keys as the basis? Is there any actual benefit? How are people able to play all these different keys so easily, is there a trick to understanding it or is it pure memorization?

62,piano,Exercise to play by feeling?,"Hello. I am not a pianist, but make music as well. I'm in my twenties and super beginner to this. I've only tried a couple of songs on keyboard (and have experienced how different it is playing on keyboard vs piano). Some friends are surprised that I play some of the songs well enough without lessons (can't really afford it). I'm sure they are nice but it actually took me quite a while to get my fingers used to those songs. I'm still a long way to go and just doing this for fun, but there is something I really wonder.

I was trying to google ""how can pianist play by ear"" because I am always amazed at how some friends or youtubers seemingly can feel songs and play them on piano just super well without sheets. But apparently I did not get what I was looking for, either because I was not looking hard enough or I put the wrong key words as I'm not an english speaker.

Let me try to describe what I was looking for. Firstly, many popular songs use chord progressions that I can recognize, as in like I can roughly write down most of those chords just by ear in one go, such as chord I to VI, flat VII, dominant 7, major 7, minor IV, etc (I'm still not used to listening to those jazzier chords and many more), and I can also recognize the melodies (although slower than the chords).

But to actually translate them into an instrument is of course a different thing, especially the melodies. For example, if I have a guitar, it is a bit easier. I can strum those chords quickly as I know them on guitar and overtime with muscle memories, my fingers get used to the positions and transitions already (although I am still not used to doing melodies on guitar). On piano/keyboard, however, even though I also know how to construct the chords and can play them like a forever amateur, I wonder how can others do it in a cool way, like one octave jump between roots, execute inversion, and other stuff ? I can only press the chords in two octave range, both hands moving together, let alone adding melodies (even if I know what the melody notes are in my head).

Beside experience, what type of routines/exercises that contribute to such skills? Is it just about getting used to practicing scales until comfortable and printed in our head?

The funny thing is, if I plug it while the piano is on, even when I don't press the pedal the sounds are sustained as if I was pressing the sustain pedal. If I turn it off and then on, the sustain doesn't appear anymore.

I know for the most part people here are musicians rather than engineers, but if you happened to have any experience with malfunctioning pedals in digital pianos I would be happy to hear your opinion on this.",1648300830

I was thinking to get the ksc70 and kpd70, but I'm not sure if the triple pedal really adds much. Since I'm a beginner, I doubt I'd use more than the sustain pedal anytime soon for standard piano sounds.
The two other pedals can turn pages via bluetooth, which is also not something I feel like I need, but I might. The only thing that seems useful right now is that the left pedal controls the rotary speaker speed on organ sounds, but I don't know if this is true. I think I read this somewhere or heard it in a video, but I can't find it anymore. Can anyone confirm? 
Of course the ksc and kpd look nicer than a regular table stand and single pedal, I'm just trying to figure out if it would be worth the extra cost or if I can save some money now and maybe upgrade later.",1648294409

35,piano,Getting back into it?,"Hiya,

I started learning the piano when I was 11 and totally loved it. I got up to about early grade 5 iirc, but by this time I was about 15-16, not enjoying it anymore, and I absolutely hated theory. I couldn't do it, I had to get my other pianist friend to help me with it. It became more of a stressor than something that I genuinely enjoyed so I dropped lessons altogether under the guise of focusing on my exams. 

Anyway, I'm 18 now and I've found myself with a bit of free time on my hands, and I genuinely miss playing and how much I used to enjoy it. I want to get back into it but I'm not sure where to start. And I'd like to do it properly, recapping the theory as I go because I know if I understand the theory perfectly I'll become a much better player. I remember the basic stuff, I can still play and all, but that's about in terms of theory I remember and in much less confident than I was 4 years ago. I'm pretty sure my father has thrown away all my old piano books and I cannot afford to take up lessons again, nor am I in a situation where that's feasible, so do any of you have any useful online websites or guides you can direct me to? Any tips or anything? I'd really appreciate it.

 Thank you.",1648233196
36,piano,Do you love or hate the Roland LX sound?,"I‚Äôm looking to get my first real (digital) piano.  I‚Äôm willing to spend several k so it looks great in my living room but I‚Äôm a beginner so I expect my tastes to evolve rapidly over the next few years.

I tried the Roland LX705 (which is probably top of my price range around $4k) and it felt and sounded great to me but I see a lot of mixed opinions about the physical modeling sound engine.  Seems to be a gap on the wiki for nicer home pianos so I‚Äôd love to get this subs opinion. I will be trying a few others like clavinovas of course but I really like the looks of the taller form factor in the LX series.  I just don‚Äôt want to buy something I like now and after training my ear regret the purchase in a year or two.

Do you have an LX and love it?  Or does the sound make you want to leave the room :)?",1648232735
37,piano,how can I get my motivation to play when I can't practice any of my favorite songs,"TL:DR - I'm discouraged because I can't play a lot of the songs I like on the piano because my piano is always a few keys short or can't be played properly cause of the missing components on it 

Ok so let me explain i have an old and  used 61 key keyboard it doesn't have  weighted keys but the sound is affected by how hard you press it for example you press the key lightly then the sound comes out softer etc. I don't have a sustain pedal and I don't have enough money to buy one, I absolutely love the piano and I love listening to classical and jazz piano but almost all the songs I want to learn and practice can't be *properly* played without a sustain pedal and most if not all can't be played on a 61 key piano 

When mom first got it for me I was extremely happy but after a few weeks as I tried looking up tutorials on how to play songs I kept on noticing I'd either 

1. Not have enough keys
2. Not have a sustain pedal and the song would sound dull when I tried to play it
Or 3. A combination of both

This really discouraged me and I went from spending hours studying music theory and practicing to only minutes practicing to sometimes just messing around on it before I'd get bored and move on to doing homework or something else 

I want to again emphasize I absolutely love the piano and sometimes play air piano while I'm at school listening to a piece but my soul gets crushed every time I try go on it to play a song since I can't learn anything 

I'm limited to the songs the keyboard gives me and I only enjoy like 4/5 pieces on the roster right now I only ""know"" gympodies by Erik satie, minuet in g major and fur elise but I haven't finished learning them yet

I want to get back into learning piano but I can't even last 10 minutes without getting disinterested

My son is 8, and is a strong intermediate player. Over the winter he worked on Rondo alla Turca...though he could never get it quite up to tempo without sacrificing accuracy.

Currently he is playing pieces such as Puttin' on the Ritz and Liszt's transcription of the William Tell Overture. Completely on his own initiative he is also working on Beethoven's¬†Path√©tique - but that is going nowhere fast and is clearly too hard for him still.

He wants to prepare a piece to play in the local Sonata Festival in the fall. It needs to be one movement of a sonata. I don't want him to get his heart set on something that will be too difficult for him to play well, so I'm hoping to put together a list of suggestions that he can choose from.

Any suggestions? He is especially drawn to pieces that are recognizable and lighthearted/humorous.

I've been considering doing lessons, but I am afraid I'll get lectured by any and all piano teachers for having long nails. They're natural, not acrylics. They're pretty long, long enough that my fingertips don't touch anything.

I have always typed and done basically everything with flat hands, and I do have great dexterity with it. My fingers are almost all double jointed too, they can all bend backwards so if I had to not tap my nails on a keyboard I would be able to do it with the same speed as regular typing.

Clipping my nails would be very difficult, as I have autism and keep them long for sensory reasons. Should I just give up on it? I wouldn't want to learn an instrument if I'll never have anyone think that I'm any good solely because of my nails.",1648203039

I'm in the process of trying to tune it but it's sooooo difficult. I mean tuning a piano is difficult anyway but this lil guy is a right pain. In the upper register the hammer isn't even striking all three strings for a lot of the notes. And muting off the strings in the upper register is super hard too. 
So it got me thinking that I might as well just sample it and then get rid of it which *then* got me thinking what itneresting things I can do with this thing and I've just thought about turning it into an una corda. 
Any thoughts? Any advice? Honestly I'm not really sure why I'm post here. Perhaps it's just a nice discussion starter about modding pianos.

12,piano,"Questions about making a living off of piano / music, and other things.","So far, 3 weeks into piano lessons and I am thoroughly enjoying it and even thinking about trying to maybe make a career out of it. It is a little demotivating how it's very difficult to make a living off of any sort of music, but I was just wondering about how I could make a living off of it.

Does anyone here make a living off of just playing piano / doing music? I've always loved music and I've always thought about it but never really thought to give it a go because I've got so many other things going on and I don't really want to make the wrong choice here.

I'm applying to colleges very soon and need to decide on what I'm going to study, on one hand I can go for music, and on the other I can go for health and fitness, it's such a difficult choice to make honestly I know this isn't a sub-reddit on life advice but I thought since it was a piano related question it would be suitable for this sub-reddit as I've always gotten quality answers.

I'm currently 3 weeks into learning sheet music and really enjoying the simple pieces I can sight-read, and seeing these people playing fantasie impromptu and chopin's etudes, it seriously just amazes me at how these people think fast, sometimes gets me wondering if these people got to those levels with sheer practice alone or with the help of some special talent they had at birth? Idk but right now I feel like it's impossible for me to ever play stuff like fantasie impromptu which is my current favourite piece.

Also learnt about Alexis Ffrench, certainly one of my favourite artists of all time honestly. Quite a long post did not intend to be this long, anyway any advice is appreciated, have a good day everyone!",1648133705
13,piano,Roland FP-60x vs Roland FP-90,"I have a bit of experience on a mid-tier upright Yamaha but I want to get a digital piano so I can practice silently without disturbing others in my home. I'm currently looking at the FP-60x and FP-90 (not the FP-90x) in Roland's collection. Which one seems better? I also had a bit of interest in the Juno-DS88 but since it's around 5 years old and the key action is outdated, sticking with a newer model seems like a better idea.

I personally like the FP-90 better due to the better action and polyphony. I'm going to be using the digital piano with Garritan CFX and if you can think of a better piano under $1700, please let me know (preferrably with the extremely customizable touch sensitivity the Roland pianos offer).",1648131709
14,piano,How do I know if my teacher is good?,"I've been learning bach prelude in c# major for two months with a teacher. I can play the piece without needing the sheet music, and can get through it with no mistakes around 90 bpm (i dont really enjoy this piece too fast anyway) However he is insisting its not enough, and to memorize each and every note. I normally agree, since i always analyze a piece before starting. However, he is not talking about harmonic analysis, but literally note for note away from the piano. I've never had a teacher this anal about reciting back notes and claims i still dont have it memorized if i can't say each and every note without looking at the sheet and that its not enough. In fact i've had teachers who dont recommend to go note for note. Its to a point of discouragement because i feel like i haven't progressed at all. I've taken piano seriously, practicing 3- 4 hours a day even with a full time job. But ever since i started with this teacher, i've really started to wonder if this is legit and I'm just mediocre or if this is overkill.

Thought i would try Liebestraum no.3 after having learnt Chopin's Aeolian harp etude. The starting section of Liebestraum was surprisingly easy and I had this idea to treat the 2nd cadenza as an exercise, while learning the rest of the piece.

I'm stumped, its been 2 days now, I can play both hands separately at 120bpm but when I do them both together, the fastest i can get to is 80bpm. I remember reading/hearing somewhere that the 2nd cadenza is typically played at 110-120bpm so it seems too far a stretch for me, should i be practicing both hands separately now? Or doing hands together?

I have NO prior experience with thirds, think i spent \~6hours on the 2nd cadenza, spread out in intervals of 15mins, in 2 days. Could someone let me know if im doing something wrong?

PS: I am self taught because i cant afford lessons right now due to heavy expenses.

For sounds I can always link it to a laptop or ipad so I don't fear having a missing sound

What other things should I be concerned about and is there any video or article on how to test a rused digital piano?

at the moment i'm learning G major stuff and rhythm. But especially on rhythm.. i feel completely lost but my teacher want me to work on it.  
Im new to the piano and was very excited to  learn every single day for hours. Now its a lot harder to get myself to play, because it feels like..i just dont have rhythm in me.  


I feel..i dont know...i get really tired and feel so unbelievable frustrated, because i just cant get the rhytm right. The biggest problem are pauses. If there is a eight-pause i get completely lost.  


Im sure, sooner or later, i will learn the G-major stuff/materials i have to go trough, but for rhythm? man, i dont know..it just feels like i dont have it inside me. I can get into the rhythm of quarters or half notes (80 beats per minute), but if there is a pause everything collapses and i have to start over, because i cant get it right and always mess it up. I just dont have ANY feeling how long i have to wait before i play the second eight note (after the pause) and how long i have to wait to play the next quarter or eight note.

Maybe you guys got some tips for me? Because i feel really down at the moment and just dont know how i can improve my rhythm before i have another lesson..youtube videos didnt helped me either.",1647997780

Alfred starts off in C with a two key gap between hands, which is fine and seems the same when I shift up to G later. When I look at other sites, some seem to put both thumbs as alternatives for the middle C, so no gap and hands adjacent. 

Are there standard hand positions like violin/cello, or is it just a case of whatever finger you fell like for any given piece? Any advice on how to go from Alfred to other pieces with different hand positions? I'm self teaching so I can't get an easy demo from a teacher!

I've been playing the piano for a few years now,

But I've learned some classical pieces using sheets. 

One thing I've been always struggling to do, is reading notes without thinking which note I'm reading (especially in bass clef). 
I still find myself counting lines from the notes I'm more familiar with, which makes learning new pieces exhausting, not talking about reading more than two notes at the same time. 
Pieces I can read easily are usually much easier to play (and more boring to me) which is frustrating to me since I can play them easily by-ear. 

What can I do to improve my reading ability?

12,piano,Fingering for Rach Prelude in Gm,"I have a question about how to handle the fingering of the ascending octaves on the last beat of the two measures shown here:

https://preview.redd.it/vp6ctzbnsro81.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e560d31b98440a0cb321650d37a70177df7aa3b9

The first measure is easy. Those are octaves. Fingers are 1 and 5 (plus 3 on the first chord). The next measure, and the subsequent ones are more interesting. They're not straight octaves, but broken up. I was playing them with this fingering: 135-5-15-5. But actually, I \*wasn't\*. I was filling in the octave even on the notes that don't have it (the Enat and G in the image above). It seemed easier to play the octaves on all the notes than on every other note.

But then I asked myself...why is it written that way in the first place?

I suspect it's because the fingering that Rachmaninoff is using is actually 124-5-124-5.

Now, I don't have huge hands. I can play the D-Bb-D chord with 124, but it's a stretch. So now I have a dilemma. I feel like my choices are:

1. Just play the straight octaves up, despite not being written like that.
2. Re-learn with the 124-5 alternation and just stretch myself a bit.

56,piano,Is 16 too late to try to become proficient enough at piano to major for it in college?,"tl;dr - I want to pursue piano as a career, but I am 16 and have only been playing for 2 years. I have decent musical knowledge as a percussionist, but lack fundamentals and basics on piano as I am completely self-taught up to this point. Am I too far behind to try to major in music for piano in college?

I‚Äôm a 16 year old junior, turning 17 in 3 months, will be a senior in 5 months. I‚Äôm a percussionist, but I started getting into piano around 2 years ago when I was 14. I‚Äôd practice for a little every couple days at first, but eventually I was practicing for about an hour almost everyday. I took a break for around half a year when life was very busy and stressful, but I continued to listen to classical music and watched lots of pianist vloggers and informational videos. When I started practicing again around 3 months ago, I realized that piano is more important to me than just about anything. I‚Äôve been practicing 2‚Äì3 hours on my own almost daily, which also made me have a disappointing realization. I‚Äôve never taken lessons before, and my skill level is only to that of being able to play pieces like Chopin Nocturne Op9 No2 and Debussy Arabesque No1 (and with many problems at that), and I can‚Äôt even sight-read using both hands although I have tried practicing it. I have taught myself from the very beginning, and lack tons of fundamentals such as proper fingering. I asked my mom if I could begin taking lessons, and she is going to allow me to. But now I‚Äôm wondering, am I too far behind to pursue piano as a career rather than a passion? I realize any music major is a gamble and incredibly competitive, and while I do love piano more than anything, I don‚Äôt want to make bad life choices. (Also I‚Äôm not sure if this is relevant, but I do have at least OK musical knowledge. I‚Äôve made all-state as a percussionist twice in high school, and I could read music before I started piano.)",1647828747

I just sold my Yamaha C3 grand piano. My plan was to either pick up a Clavinova or a NU1X (both Yamaha). I went to play test those models yesterday.

Most people will respond with, ""read more,"" and I get that the only way to improve is to expose yourself to more music but it feels a little vague.

Like, yeah I could just read more but am I reading things that are helpful and will actually improve my sight-reading skill? How do I know? I'm wondering if there are pieces or genres best for improving.

I'm also curious about your opinions on abrsm sight-reading books. (I'm not doing the abrsm exam btw) I want to make sure I get a pretty good score in the sight-reading part of my exam and if they're not that good what resources did you find helped you improve? 

I'm really just trying to maximize things I guess. I don't want to spend 10 years clunking away at pop songs until I can call myself an ok sight-reader. I want to actually learn and improve and be able to apply the skills I learn to other pieces.",1647803967

0,piano,Yamaha P45 vs M Audio Hammer 88,"I own a Yamaha p45 and I've been using it as a midi controller to play piano vsts and libraries, but it's really not very responsive to the velocity, it has 3 levels of responsiveness but all they do is shift the velocity values you have access to, so the more sensitive setting allows you to play from, let's say, 0 - 90, the medium one 10 - 110, and the least sensitive 20 - 127 (those are not the actual values, just so you can understand how it works). So I'm thinking of getting a controller that allows me to play a wider range of velocities with just one setting, while having a keybed as good or better as the p45 (wich is alright imo), so the hammer 88 is the one I'm thinking, but I would really appreciate if someone would share your experiences with the hammer 88 and even better if you have played both controllers.

Even more important to me is the change in perspective I‚Äôve had about performing live since I‚Äôve started to play for audiences for the first time in more than two years. This long time of not being able to play for others has improved my perspective on the opportunity to play live.

 I am no longer as nervous, simply excited because I get to share my music! Even with some mistakes and slips I still have a lot of fun and know the audience enjoys it. At the retirement home I played at, it meant so much to walk out and be thanked by the people there for my performance. Heck, I played a measure twice because I forgot where I was and they didn‚Äôt know! At another performance the wife of a board member for the music program I am in was so excited for my performance. I can hear her yell and applause on the video!

I recently resumed my piano studies with a new teacher and I want to use the free time I have at work to keep studying piano so I'm thinking about getting a semi-weighted keys digital piano, either an SL Numa Compact 2 or maybe a Roland GO 88. This would be my main study instrument and would allow me to study between 5 or 6 hs a day. I already have a Casio Privia at home but that one I will play like 1 hr a day at most.

I am aware of the downsides but the reason for this is the weight of the actual instrument because I will be carrying it around (a lot) and there's a BIG difference (for me at least) between 23 lbs of a Casio CPD-S100 (which I believe is the lightest of all the fully-weighted keys DPs) and the 15 lbs of the semi-weighted ones I mentioned before. That's a 4 kg difference.

After 2.5 years, I quit taking lessons and a few years later started playing guitar. I then went back to piano another few years after that, and haven't returned to sheet music. 

How do I play you might ask? I jam. I learn theory, technique, fingerings, chord progressions, licks, etc. I love being able to sit down and play whatever I'm feeling. However, after doing this strictly for years, I'm hitting a plateau and find it hard to come up with new ideas without finding a new lesson on YouTube.

My fear is that I will become someone who is reliant on sheet music, and I'll lose my ability to ""jam""; to play what I'm feeling and create.

92,piano,"whenever I think of something personal, a melody subconsciously pops into my head. this has been happening since last year. is this a form of synesthesia?","for the past year whenever I think of something that is personal or I show interest in, a melody pops up in my head. I know this is very weird but I am wondering if this is a ""common"" thing or something that shouldn't happen at all. it wasn't a problem at the start because it rarely happened, but for the past 3-4 months it started progressing a lot. 

I was thinking of my childhood and this loud melody just popped into my head. when I was trying to sleep last night, I thought of my deceased dog and another melody popped into my head. I was reading about vampires and a melody popped into my head. I heard what happened in Ukraine and a melody popped into my head. I heard news of a baby and a melody for a lullaby popped into my head. it honestly makes me a little crazy because I cant keep on rushing to write down everything I hear, and when I do it frustrates me because I cant write down what I am hearing because its complicated. and whats even more infuriating is when it happens in public, I cant just hum what I hear into my phone, people will think I'm crazy. at times it is very nice to have to express what I feel, but when it is happening \*constantly\* it can be quite infuriating. often times I just ignore it now... it also even happens when I listen to music, I am listening and my mind wants to take the melody to a different direction so I'm left unsatisfied but deal with it.

I honestly have no idea why this is happening, if anybody knows anything please enlighten me. I know this is a very weird thing to ask and honestly I'm a little hesitant to ask because of how weird it sounds to ask...",1647676983

As I am learning the Beethoven op 28 Sonata, I have been looking for a second piece to add some variety to my practice (having just finished a Haydn sonata).

I have played some Chopin, most notably the op 15 no 3 Nocturne, the op 55 no 1 (I believe?), a mazurka or two and 2 preludes I believe along with the op 69 no 2 waltz.

The issue for me lies is that I cannot find anything that doesn't either seem too hard to me, or simply boring. There are plenty of Chopin pieces I simply don't like, but I can't find anything accessible that I truly want to learn.

I guess I'm venting in a way? Or trying to get some suggestions for fun pieces? I am not sure myself, but I can never really 'stick' with Chopin's pieces, and I hesitate to even truly add the op15 no 3 and op 55 to my list of pieces I played since I think I am still embarassingly bad at those pieces, I just can't find the motivation to truly practice them.

I'm looking for a good electric piano that emulates, to the extent possible, the tactile experience of playing on a grand piano.  I grew up playing on a grand, and I know what that feels like.   A musician friend of mine, knowing that I have Logic, said that the grand piano samples in Logic were ""great"" and that I would do well -- and save money -- by purchasing an excellent MIDI controller keyboard (which, of course, I could use for other things as well).

I have done some research, but haven't come up with anything definite.  StudioLogic keyboards seems to be one contender with their T/40 (?) action.  But I've read reviews where the key coating came off after a year, revealing rough wood underneath.  I'm also hesitant to drop more than a grand on any brand when it may prove to be imperfect, and when I know so little about what I'm looking for.  Every keyboard I've researched seems to come with a fair number of people dissatisfied with it.  So I was thinking: perhaps try out something a little cheaper with the thought that it's an experiment...

Does the controller+Logic seem a good route forward, compared to getting a stand-alone electric piano?  Can you recommend a good controller that will truly FEEL like a piano?   I would be looking for something available in the EU, but I suppose many of the top brands are Japanese, and as such, are available everywhere.   The budget?  I had thought less than ‚Ç¨1000, but if it's a bit above, I'll consider that too.  If it's considerably less, that would be even better!   I'm hoping if I were to get just the controller, it might be cheaper.

Also, how do pedals work if it's just a controller?

57,piano,A different approach to reading music,"tl;dr: Can't seem to learn to read music the traditional way, want to learn solfege first. What do you think?

\------------------------------------------

So I'm an adult beginner, and I have quite a serious problem with learning to read music, and merely practice - whether just trying to learn a new, even very simply notated piece - or even worse trying to sight read, doesn't really help me improve a single bit.

I've had bad luck a number of years ago with a piano teacher who insisted I try to sight read pieces, even though it was evident to her that I couldn't even recognize most of the information on the page, and was still counting up and down the staff - and couldn't even follow time; But that's all we did every lesson, for about a year, until I got fed up with making no progress and being frustrated that I can't read even basic notation.

I haven't had a teacher since, nor did I barely play at all, but I have sat down occasionally to learn a new piece, only to get frustrated that I can't. So there's a strong psychological element of frustration when I actually try to read, and as long as I keep trying to learn the same way, It will only put me off from trying to learn.

But I have an idea, and since almost every music program in higher education requires this at the outset, it might not be completely unproductive even if it's not the right approach:

I've been thinking about starting with learning solfege, ear training and melodic, harmonic and rhythmic dictation, at least to a college entrance exam level - before ever sitting down at the piano and trying to play a piece from sheet music.

At the very least, I'll have some ability to ""hear"" at least part of what's written on the page in my head, and I'll be able to track pitch and rhythm correctly - even if my hands won't necessarily do what my brain tells them to.

At the psychological level, I might ""break through"" this barrier of frustration that prior negative experience created for me.

What do you think about this? Do you think this skill will actually transfer to the keyboard? Do you have another idea? I will really appreciate reading your feedback.",1647609611

87,piano,Need to vent about concert staff member,"So a couple weeks ago, I went to see Bruce Liu (Chopin Competition winner) perform live in Vancouver. His playing was incredible and I loved every bit of the concert. When we came out of the hall, we saw there was a line of people and a Tom Lee backdrop thingy set against a wall. We presumed that he would be coming out to take pictures, so we got in line.

We waited for around 15 minutes, just talking with friends/old teachers until a member of the concert hall's staff told us that Bruce wouldn't be coming out for pictures. Disappointed, we left. A couple hours later, I go on Instagram and see Bruce Liu standing next to another person, in front of that exact location I had previously been. I went through #bruceliu even more and saw several pictures just like that one.

I'm still really pissed off about this and I have no idea why the staff told us Bruce wouldn't be coming out. I don't think I'll ever get the chance again, and Bruce is probably my favourite pianist at the moment. I guess there's nothing I can do now but I just wanted to let it out.",1647561709

Now, I've heard complaints about the PHA-4 standard and people make it seem like its the worst key action in the world - though they might just mean its not great considering the high quality of everything else. Was just curious if the PHA-4 standard is significantly better than the GHS keys. Also would like to know the comparison between the PHA4 Standard and the RH3

Next, my eyes have been really set on Kawaii and been deciding between the MP7SE and ES920 and upon research, I haven't found many reviews on the MP7SE but found many for the ES920. What really confuses me is that I've found more people interested in the ES920 even though there is a 200$ price difference between the two, 
 as well as the MP7SE having way more features. Is there something I'm not catching on too? 

I apologize about my mess of questions . I know some of you might be thinking ""well try it out yourself"" and though I'm likely to travel 45 miles to my closest music store, they are very unlikely to have the ones I'm deciding on or not have it on display. I'm likely to try their other roland and kawai products with the same key action. But also, its hard to decide how good the key action is from just one try on them, a lot of other factors take time to notice.

Anyway, thanks in advance

However, a side view is entirely unhelpful when it comes that sort of thing.

I used to start a video, put the phone in my mouth, hold it between my teeth, and play. However, I recently got a new phone that's slightly wider than my old phone, and I can't fit it in my mouth. I've tried propping it up slightly behind me as an over-the-shoulder view, but it's still kinda difficult to see what I'm playing.

Ideally, I would somehow suspend the phone above the piano, pointing downward, but I haven't figured out a setup. Eye level would probably be the next best thing. I've tried tucking it in between my neck and chest, but it tends to fall out, and I have to point my head downward. It's just awkward and cumbersome.

I know the octaves are quarter notes so ideally you're supposed to hold them for the entire duration, but with the sustaining effect of the pedal, does anyone feel it doesn't sound all that different if you let go of the octave a bit earlier so the thumb/pinky can help with the tremolo?

Since I was a kid, I loved piano with every fiber of my soul. I've never played it because my parents always dismissed my passion to piano and deemed it worthless and a waste of time, even when I grew up, they didn't let me buy my own piano. I guess many are familiar with this, even Hans Zimmer related to that in his masterclass. 

Now that I live alone, I finally can get my own piano. Unfortunately, since my lack of space, I can't get the classical, massive saloon-piano, but no problem with electric keyboard.

I'm debating either Alesis Recital Pro,  CASIO CDP S100 (both are same price for like 500$) which is available in my local store and Rockjam 61 keys (70$) which I can order from Amazon (+50$ shipping so basically 120$). In my local store, there isn't much of other options but at higher prices.

Both of them seem pretty good for beginners, but I'm not sure which one will be more fitting for me right from the get-go. 

I try to avoid spending more than 500$, If I'll need to upgrade in the future, no problem there. 

Additionally, I've seen the App SimplyPiano which looks really good and interactive and ordered Alfred Adult All In One Course. I guess they can go well together for learning?

I started learning the piano when I was 8 years but was never serious with it. In 2015, I stopped taking lessons and by 2020, couldn't even get through the C Major scale. After struggling a lot with mental health and just being unhappy with how my life was going, I got back to music and this time around, it was different. Playing and sharing music from the great repertoire of Western Classical music gives me purpose and a sense of sheer joy and fulfillment. I finally realized that playing the piano is what I was meant to do with my life.

I live in India and the Western Classical music infrastructure is not the best. I've been fortunate to find one of the best teachers in the country. However, in an attempt to improve technique and tone, she now recommends participating in programs to learn from conservatory professors in Europe.

I was invited to the Echo Summer Academy and to learn with Prof. Balazs Fulei from the Liszt Conservatory of Music this summer but it's expensive and I can't afford it. So I started a fundraiser and am now on here asking for contributions towards my dream of becoming a professional pianist. The fundraiser is at:

This makes me ""see"" an A, for instance, but in reality  the note is a C and if i look away and back or double check it ""flips"" back to a C. It's kind of like those magic eye posters where the image will suddenly change- except it's notes on sheet music.

* I do not have trouble reading words, nor do I have dyslexia

* I do wear glasses, but glasses or no the effect is the same as I am near sighted

* I play many instruments, it occurs on all of them

* Chords do not typically give me grief, only melodic lines

* The density of notes, barlines, expressions, and articulation on the page correlates with the intensity of the issue

I would like to start learning piano for once. I know how to play a couple of things, I know my chords and I can play melodies while spamming left hand chords. I can read music as I've been a guitarist and a choir singer for decades, so that's not a problem.

What I struggle with and I'd like to improve is left-right hand independance and learning pieces that require me to separate both, or even play different notes at the same time with both hands.

Is there any method book, any studio book that I could use as a reference? I do use the ""the art of finger dexterity"" as a base to warm up, although as I've never been too disciplined, I've never gone past the 5th piece.

When I started playing guitar, my teacher followed a method that would increasingly get more and more complex and that's what I am looking for. Something that will ""guide"" me into getting more dexterity over time.

62,piano,Beginner achievement post: I sightread something for the first time today!,"Ok so the music was a basic Grade 1 piece - and I only sightread one hand. Probably not very impressive, but it‚Äôs a very exciting achievement to me. 


Usually when I try sightreading, unless it‚Äôs something like a scale, I would constantly have to take a few seconds to process where my fingers should go next and count out the notes. Even reading just one hand at a time - any position shifts or moving my fingers beyond a 5 note scale would require a small pause to think. I usually start learning pieces with the metronome at 40-50% pace, and I sometimes can‚Äôt keep up with that. 


But today I sat down with a piece I‚Äôd never heard of before, put on the Metronome at about 70% tempo, and sightread the entire right hand part without skipping a beat!


One year ago I was one of those people who was like ‚ÄúIs 30 too late to start learning piano?‚Äù 


So the feeling of my fingers moving to where they need to go automatically, without my brain melting or needing to take a break, is incredible! I actually never thought I‚Äôd be able to do this. 


This sub gets a lot of questions about reading music - I highly recommend other beginners try and learn. It is SO SO HARD but with enough practice it‚Äôll eventually click.

I have a keyboard that's actually not even full size that I've been practicing on. I've played the guitar for many years, was a choir boy for a while, and even composed and wrote music. Therefore, I have a decent understanding of music theory in general, maybe a little lacking in chord theory and harmonization if anything. As for the actual piano, I'm familiar with basic major and minor chords and can play and interchange between them without much struggle, not a big achievement but where I'm at. The one thing I always struggle to do is play different things with both hands, I don't know why but it's the bane of my existence. I imagine I'm oversimplifying things and it's a lot more complex, but I was wondering if there's any way I can learn piano by myself, given the current situation I'm in. I'm willing to get a course or whatever, but considering the way people react to simply piano it doesn't seem like the way to go. Any advice is helpful, thanks in advance.",1647324641

Sometimes, after playing for a while, my forearms get tense and start aching. I never realized this was a problem until now; I learned that my entire technique and possibly my posture were wrong. I haven't taken a piano lesson in over five years, but when I used to, my teachers never stressed the importance of technique to me, so I always assumed that I was doing everything right. Now these bad habits are so ingrained in my playing that I find it awkward, if not impossible, to try and change them on my own.

I am at a loss and do not know how to fix this.

Hello everyone I'm a Master's student in Vancouver Canada. Me and my friends are developing a piano learning app called Warbler that focuses on giving users feedback.  

What sets us apart from the millions of piano teaching apps out there are that we do not attempt to replace the teacher, but rather, make your piano learning process easier by having goal setting and planning features (think Strava and Duolingo) and most importantly, providing feedback either from our default analytics (note accuracy, tempo...) or through connecting users with their current instructors for a seamless feedback loop on your piano skills (think Canvas)  

As piano learners from all kinds of levels ourselves, we had frustration with going to piano practices and waiting on instructors to give feedback one by one for each kid, as well as the struggle of a beginner who would randomly look for songs to practice on Youtube and doze off as soon as a distraction arises. Therefore, we hope to focus on feedback and goal tracking!  

We would love to receive your feedback on this idea in the comment as well as your support by joining the newsletter in the link below!

I have playing for a few years and looking to get a portable (less than 10kg) piano with a limited budget of a thousand pounds. Otherwise I would get a nord electro most probably but I would like to stay in a reasonable budget.

My main piano right now is a roland fp30 and I really like the feel but, too long and way too heavy.

I have been looking around for a little bit and it seems that the models I am interested in are rather hard to find in a shop to test them.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking initially at:

* roland vr 09
* numa compact 2x
* vox continental 64 (probably)
* dexibell vivo s1

&amp;#x200B;

From what I gathered the keys of the roland are quite bad, the sound of the numa seem not great on the demos and bad for some reviews, the vox is hard to find and has a problematic power supply (possibly?) and the vivo well ... is almost at the top of the budget limit, sounds good but not much information as with most of the boards there.

39,piano,What are some good piano concerto movements that match my criteria?,"Hi, high school pianist here. I don‚Äôt use Reddit much so sorry if there‚Äôs any problems with this post.

My youth orchestra (also a cellist) holds an annual concerto competition with the audition typically being early December. To give you an idea of my playing level, I auditioned last year and it took me about 2 months to get the Beethoven No.3 second movement ‚Äúperformance ready.‚Äù Such a joy to learn by the way. Unfortunately I did not get chosen, but I really want to be chosen next year so I‚Äôm already thinking about another piece! I want to give myself some extra time (say, start at August instead of October) so can pick a more technically challenging piece. However, it‚Äôs not so easy where I can pick a movement from a concerto I love *cough* Grieg *cough* because there are restrictions. Since I am part of a chamber orchestra they have to hire all the brass and woodwind parts. As such, here are the orchestration limitations:

2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, and strings.

In other words, most (if not all) mid-Romantic and beyond pieces are off the table. I also have a couple of preferences (though I am flexible):
- I want to be able to learn the movement in 4 months MAX with my ability level. The hardest piece I‚Äôve ever played was Chopin‚Äôs Ballade No. 1 which took a whopping 6 months to learn. I was quite demotivated by the end so I don‚Äôt want to have too challenging of a piece.
- I‚Äôve already played a slow second movement from a concerto, so I‚Äôd prefer to try a faster or at least more technically challenging first or third movement.
- Not a huge baroque fan (sorry)
- It would be great if there was a strong string accompaniment. Unfortunately the director of my orchestra did not pick winners from the audition alone. He also wanted to make sure that everyone else in the orchestra would have some sort of challenge, and as I mentioned earlier, I am in a strings-only orchestra.

74,piano,How do you go about memorizing pieces?,"Hi I've been playing the piano for 6 years now and my piano reading skills are outpacing my memorization, to the point where memorizing a piece is significantly harder than for me to read and play it from the sheet music. 

The last time I had to memorize was around 2 years ago pre pandemic when I played in my teacher's recital however my reading back then was atrocious so I could only rely on finger muscle memory and my own memory which would take hours and hours of drilling to get down.

During these 2 years I went back to basics and played all of Clementi's sonatinas as well as sight read 1 Bach piece and 1 Czerny piece a day. 

Now I'm finding it much much more difficult to memorize an entire piece, I honestly don't know if it's just my age because I started as an adult and I'm getting older or if it's because I haven't actively memorized a piece for performance for over 2 years. Probably some combination of both....

Would like to hear some thoughts from the more experienced folks here on how they encountered and overcame this. FYI when I say reading I don't mean sight reading but rather practiced and trained with the sheet music.",1647205635

The keys are a a pinch slimmer, lighter and more sensitive. It makes all the dynamics I practiced sound not so great. I would have to play even lighter on the acoustic piano to make it play quieter and it messes with my muscle memory. And then I end up playing worse. It's already bad enough that I get slightly anxious playing in front of others, but this difference makes it more difficult to play my best.

92,piano,Playing Without a Musical Ear?,"I take a while explaining before I get to the actual question so, sorry about that.

So back when I just started playing the piano, I really skipped a lot of stuff because I just wanted to play and so I ended up simply memorizing the keys I had to hit in order to play the piece. In doing so, it wasn't necessary to do anything else and my mind never processed what was actually happening. It just memorized the keys to hit and there would be times I'd forget which key I'd need to press in order to continue playing.

So a few months ago, I started taking lessons again and started really putting work. I developed a clear goal, I wanted to achieve musical fluency. And of course if you were going to do that, you'd actually need to be able to perceive how music worked which I absolutely did not before. And so to achieve that, I set out with ear training. I use this app called ""Functional Ear Trainer"" and I've made serious progress since. Because of my ear training, I can actually kind of hear the notes in the music I play now; so now I memorize the actual notes within the context of a key (back then, I sometimes didn't even know the key I was playing in, I just memorized the notes to hit. It was pretty bad) and I can hear what they do. So like E in the key of G is La.

I've read read a few things and heard a few things before about pianists who play great and do performances yet they cannot play by ear? I remember seeing this post about a guy talking comparing a jazz pianist he knew to a classical pianist or whatever who plays these high level difficulty pieces yet who are incredible sight readers yet they are unable to play by ear? Whilst the jazz pianist has it all in his head and doesn't bother learning to get good at reading sheet music because it's unnecessary for him?

Now, I do sort of have this image of how people are kind of trained just to hit notes in some cases. But that doesn't do with jazz because improvisation requires fluency. The way I see it, you aren't fluent if you can't play by ear. It's like memorizing sentences in French and knowing the general idea of what you're saying but you don't actually know what most of the words translate to. 

So to anyone here to plays technically difficult pieces and has an untrained ear, how? How does that work? Do you or do you not have a perception of the individual notes you're playing? Or do you just know what they're called without knowing what they, alone, sound like? If this is the case, why would you go on like this?",1647192033
93,piano,"About to have no piano, help me work through some options","Hi all - my ex is taking my Yamaha P-95 in the divorce, so I'm using this as an excuse to (possibly) upgrade. As you'll see, I've fairly flexible with my setup and I'll have my whole basement as my new music studio. Whatever I get will stay in the studio, so portability is not a factor. 

Things that are important to me:

\- immediacy: I want to be able to sit down and make music quickly

\- action: I want it to feel as much like a real piano as possible

\- recording: I'd like to easily record what I'm playing

\- effects: I'd love to be able to tweak delay and reverb in real time

\- sounds: the more sound options the better, I'd also love to split and layer sounds

\- price: I'd like to be as cheap as possible, but I also don't want to buy something cheap. Price range $0-$2k

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the options I see:

\- Cheap upright piano on FB marketplace, would have to pay someone to move it

pros: immediacy, real pianos just feel good, I'd also love the ability to prepare it in some way since I like the ability to play weird music 

cons: cheap pianos probably don't have a great action, but better than a cheap keyboard. Buying a cheap used piano is an iffy investment

&amp;#x200B;

\- Electric piano: Maybe Kawai MP7SE or Roland RD88 (any other good options in this price range?!?)

pros: more sounds, better sounds than a cheap upright (with good speakers), effects!, reasonable immediacy

cons: price

&amp;#x200B;

\- Komplete Kontrol s88 midi keyboard + NI Komplete

pros: ALL THE SOUNDS, I particularly want the Noire and Una Corda

cons: not as much immediacy, lining up effect chains would take a bit, price, possibly too many choices

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards the electric piano option. I spent an hour playing a Nord Grand at a store yesterday, but it's too expensive. I'm leaning toward the Kawai MP7SE since it has the same keybed. But I'm also looking for other recommendations, too!

Any thoughts? I haven't shopped for a keyboard in a looooong time.",1647190180

As you can see in the video, the noise does not appear when the keys are played with less force.

Makes me slightly wonder if I'm somehow a fraud for practicing more than my professor may think, although I assume increased hours of practice is part of the game when advancing through the levels/grades.

20,piano,Is it normal for piano lessons to stress you out?,"I started my piano lessons a month ago. I am in school and told my teacher that I‚Äôd like to start off a bit slow and once the summer hits I‚Äôll be able to practice more, so currently I am doing one 30 minute lesson per week.

The first two lessons were somewhat slow, we are using the faber adult piano adventures book, we could have done a faster paced book but I declined because I want to learn the basics. As I said, the first two lessons were a bit slow, and I found myself not practicing as much because I was having an easy time with the songs.

I then had to miss the third lesson because I was overwhelmed with school work, don‚Äôt plan on making this a habit. 

Then the next lesson, I had worked ahead a little bit since I missed the previous weeks lesson. This next lesson we were going very fast, she said she was ‚Äúpushing me‚Äù, which honestly I don‚Äôt mind. If anything I want to be pushed.

The thing is I still am having a bit of a hard time reading the notes from the staff. We get through like 15 pages, which includes 6 songs for me to learn. I have learnt them all by this point and can play them all well I‚Äôd say, the last song in this series is Mozart‚Äôs ‚Äúa little night music‚Äù, I try to play it in time as much as possible and keep a good rythm. 

I just constantly fear that I will mess up one of the songs at the next lesson and that I‚Äôll look like an idiot. Even for the slower lessons when I would have as many songs, I still would constantly fear that I‚Äôd mess it up. I‚Äôll show up to her house a nervous wreck just hoping I don‚Äôt let myself down.

She seems to be nice, but I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm a bad student/ let her down. I am 22 so I feel like I am already way behind since she mostly teaches kids I think, I don‚Äôt want her to have little kids that progress more quickly than me.

Is it normal to feel these nerves? It sort of takes some of the relaxation out of playing because if I make one mistake I get pretty upset with myself. I‚Äôve practiced for quite some time on these relatively easy songs.

I can‚Äôt help but look ahead and worry that I‚Äôm just too dumb to become a good pianist. I can‚Äôt fathom playing well with two hands, do you think my teacher sees me in a bad light?  I can‚Äôt help but be very stressed about this.",1647035511

My two biggest weaknesses are my rhythm

But an issue that is starting to hurt my playing ability, is reading notes at a fast rate. I know you're supposed to read the notes as you play and even try to look ahead(this is what my teacher said), however playing the notes and reading them is something I didn't realize how much I struggled with it. I know the grand staff pretty much perfectly, I use a site called musictheory.net to practice, and it doesn't take longer than half a second, or one full second to know what note it is. 

But playing the notes and reading them is very different, especially when it comes to playing with both hands. Is there any way to improve this, or exercises to improve, other than just playing the pieces that are assigned?

I know my rhythm struggles, but I think it's more because I hesitate to identify the notes while playing, so I end up adding a beat or two on accident. The note reading issue is starting to become frustrating, as we're getting into harder pieces with chords and sharp keys, and it's making me constantly mess up.

63,piano,What do I need to learn if I want to play jazz harmonies?,"Hi, I'm a student of jazz guitar and also I play the keyboard as a second instrument. I have pretty advanced knowledge about harmony and I'm interested in being capable of playing jazz harmonies and accompanying on my keyboard (no soloing or improvising, that's another world that I don't want to get into currently)

However, I've seen that chords are played differently as usual and there are a lot of voicings, I don't even know what exactly I ""need"" to do with the hand that isn't playing a chord. Various people said to me that it's normal to play the 3 &amp; 7 with the right hand and the root with the left, others said to me that the 3 &amp; 7 are played with the left and with the right you add color (when you're playing extended chords and where is a bassist who plays the root), etc, etc. In a few words: I'm totally lost.

If someone has a book/pdf of voicings/harmony applied to jazz piano I would really appreciate that (idk even know if that's what I need, but I supposed that).

I played the violin since I was 5 until I was about 15, I studied in a conservatory and I had some piano lessons there, but never got to the interesting part (I quit for a variety of reasons, life is hard) I'm 26 now. 

Bought a Roland FP-10, and searched online for books. People suggest Alfred's basic piano books for starters. Unfortunately I find them too basic for me. Maybe I did get some basics back then. I also have perfect pitch so that helps I guess. Not that I can play every song in those books right away but you get the idea, I mean, I don't need to learn how to read sheet music or the F clef etc. And the songs aren't too complicated for me either.

Any other suggestions? I think I want more of a technique book rather than one that teaches you a bit of theory and songs.",1646868549

65,piano,I can't decide which Digital Piano Synth Workstation To get,"hey! :) so I'm looking for a piano for long-term use. The target budget would be $1700. I'm a beginner and i am aware of Actions, polyphony, and velocity-sensitive if that's what i should look for in a good piano. I had a really old Yamaha PSR-180 =/ so now I know that I wouldn't like that kind of action keybed. If looking for tones it isn't really what I'm worried about. It is the layering and split is that I'm after. And some Synth too. I know Casio px 560 has hex layers. (i Wish i can do that on Roland RD 88 so i won't be asking for help here right now ) :( Please correct me if I'm wrong there. my Friends do pick a lineup of songs by Bon Jovi,  maybe Van Halen. Mostly old-school music. And they do worship songs too. I wanted to choose the right or a closer piano for any of that. At the same time, i like the '80s and new wave. So with synth is a must. Also with built-in speakers.

i have 4 choices in mind, and that's Roland RD 88, Korg Krome EX 88, Yamaha MX88, and Casio PX 560 and all are 88 notes. What I know is all 4 have good actions and specs. what I don't know is can I compare them all? If there is a keyboard with a synth/workstation or maybe not a workstation just a digital piano with synth under $1700 what would u recommend?

  
Synth workstation digital piano arranger is confusing to me. I don't know which/what category am i in. I'm new to the piano world but my top choice is Roland RD 88.

I've been playing the piano (the digital one) for about 1 year and 2 months (with some breaks) and as of today I'm the owner of an acoustic upright piano. It's great, it feels great, I love the bass sound, the sustain etc but... it just feels so much different. The bass keys are much heavier than the rest, and even among them it's not the same weight (lower octaves feel heavier). I'm also not yet used to hearing it that loud, it feels like even playing in **p** sounds like **mf**, compared to my digital (which had weighted keys - Yamaha p45b) which I had it on like 60-75% volume.

Also playing in **p** feels a bit more difficult since it happened quite a few times to press the key but too soft at the end resulting in the hammer not hitting the strings properly :(

Probably my neighbors already hate me.

All the repertoire played on my digital feels different on the acoustic, I can't get it to the same level as on the digital. So getting back to the question, are there any tips I could use for easily switching from my digital to the acoustic? Did you face any of the issues when you had switched?",1646846247

My wife and I are in the market for an upright with max budget around $10k. Have a Yamaha and Steinway dealer in town we visited once recently and plan to visit more. Both the Essex 123 and Yamaha U1 were $9k-$10k brand new. 

On the Essex I enjoyed the warm mellow tones and reverberating bass. The touch was very controllable. My research indicates it is built in China and the line has maybe less than a 20 year history.

On the Yamaha the tone was a little too bright and punchy. Bass was present but less ‚Äúwoofy‚Äù and reverberative. Touch was lighter and difficult to tenderly adjust between dynamics. Built in Japan with a rich history of course and a name I find trustworthy.

75,piano,I need help choosing between the Kawai ES520 and KDP120...,"So I will be getting a digital piano soon and I have been putting in a lot of research into different models and I've narrowed my choices down to two Kawai pianos, but I have a problem choosing between them; so I thought I would turn to you guys to help me... (TL;DR at end of post)

The first piano is the Kawai ES520 Portable Digital... This piano costs between 1000-1100 euros where I live (France) and is the middle of Kawai's ES Portable Digital lineup. Now this being a portable digital it doesn‚Äôt come with a triple pedal but they do give you a very nice metal sustain pedal with half pedaling. The action is Kawai's RHC II and the sound itself is a sample of Shigeru Kawai's SK-EX 9' concert grand with string and damper resonances. It comes with Kawai's ""Virtual Technician"" (which allows you to adjust 17 parameters like touch curve, voicing, damper noise etc) and a total of 34 Sounds to choose from (plus 3 amp simulators). Finally, speaker-wise, you get two 20W front facing speakers for a total of 40W. One thing this piano has that the other doesn't is a display, although I don't think it's too much of a difference-maker, and note that this piano has half the recording capacity (5,000 notes) of the KDP's 10,000.

The second is the Kawai KDP120 Home Digital... It also costs 1000-1100 euros here in France and is Kawai's only currently produced KDP series home digital. It being a home digital, they give you a really nice triple pedal system integrated into the lower body with metal pedals and half pedaling on all three. The action is the same as the ES520, the Kawai RHC II and the sound is also a sample of the SK-EX; but while it has damper resonance, it lacks string resonance (which is included in the ES). The KDP also comes with Kawai's ""Virtual Technician"", but it comes with 10 parameters instead of the 17 on the ES. It has less sounds in total with 17 sounds instead of 34 and lacks Amp Simulators. And coming to the speakers, you have once again two 20W speakers for a total of 40W. as said above, the KDP doesn't have a display but who cares, really... Also I should note that this one doesn't have a keyboard splitting function while the ES does. 

Now before you say in the comments, I do know that getting the matching triple pedal board and stand for the ES520 will cost an extra 200 euros, but 1. You CAN get them later and 2. You can use a portable stand and get Kawai's Floating Triple Pedal system for the same functionality...

In terms of my use, I'm a classically trained pianist and so I don't care THAT much about the piano's other sounds, and mainly will use the main Acoustic Piano sound, but I like to occasionally mess around with the other sounds. I also do compositions on my computer so MIDI connection is important for me, but both of these come with both wired USB connection and also Bluetooth MIDI so not a problem with either. I also don't really use the Sostenuto and Una Corda pedals now, but I imagine they would be useful as I make progress in my learning process. I used to have an actual acoustic piano, a Yamaha b1 (also called JU109 in some markets) but now have to switch to a digital because of my situation.

# TL;DR:

I am a classically trained pianist and I need to choose between the Kawai KDP120 home digital and the Kawai ES520 portable digital. 

KDP120 Benefits: 

* Stand Assembly and Triple Pedal included in price
* Sliding clavier cover
* Twice the recorder memory (10,000 notes vs 5,000 on the ES)

ES520 Benefits:

* Sampled String Resonance
* More settings within Kawai's Virtual Technician 
* More sounds (as well as an amp simulator)
* Keyboard Splitting
* A Display (but I don't think that one is too important)

What they share:

* Two 20W speakers (for a total of 40W)
* Kawai's RHC II action",1646729053

96,piano,About piece memorization.,"So I recently heard that memorizing pieces instead of constantly reading through them can have a negative effect, particularly for new players with slower sight reading skills. I memorize nearly every piece I learn right now as a new player, mostly because that‚Äôs how I learned pieces before I started playing seriously. My dad was always good at playing by ear, so I‚Äôd ask him to teach me something by note and rhythm memorization. That became pretty much how I learned everything before, and I just felt out the next note if I forgot it. Now that I want to become a better piano player, I understand that reading music is very important, and I‚Äôve been working to improve my sight reading. Would the best method be to focus on a larger piece that forces me to constantly learn new measures? I prefer to try to perfect sections before I move on, but I could try to change that if I need to. Is there some other method that works better? Should I not worry about it too much and just keep learning the way I have been? I‚Äôve been playing for less than a year, and have completed James Bastien‚Äôs Older Beginner book, Chopin‚Äôs Prelude in C Minor, and a few other simpler pieces. If it would be best to focus on a larger piece, is there one close to the Prelude that you would recommend? Thank you for your advice.",1646702098

I have always been a huge fan of the music from the Zelda series and feel it plays a very important role on why the games are so memorable. I learned a lot about music thanks to the series and always had the dream of seeing how it all was made.

That is why I was happy to learn that the actual music from the games made during the Nintendo 64 era (and even beyond!) lives inside the games' ROM files and code. Then, after playing around a with some tools, I managed to get the original files used. Everything is there, from the instruments used to the instructions on how they should be played, and the sequences; dynamics included!.

This is an unprecedented look inside the score of a high budget and influential project. Now we can get an almost perfect reproductions of the music as standard music files. For the moment, I intend to put all the music out there as 'piano visualization videos' that you may find interesting because it shows all the orchestration and harmonies used in those soundtracks. Check the playlist, which I intend to update with the full soundtracks of different iconic games:

This is great to gain more appreciation for the music and a valuable resource for musicians and audio enthusiasts. I am researching if it is possible to do the same for other consoles. 

So anyway, I was just happy to report that I finally fulfilled my dream of having access to the song files and seeing how they were put together √¢‚Ç¨¬ùsurprisingly, with fewer instruments than I though!. Koji Kondo really did put a lot of care into these soundtracks.√Ç

I'm wanting to teach myself piano, primarily to play classical and jazz, as well as improvisation maybe eventually. I'm an entirely self-taught guitarist, having started over a decade ago. I started off playing a lot of odd progressive rock/metal and eventually moved into fingerstyle acoustic, jazz, and classical. These days I honestly mostly prefer to simply improvise.

I also write/compose/produce music to an extent, though only for intrinsic enjoyment. That said, as a result of all this, I have an odd grasp for music theory where I have a knowledge and intuition for all the basics, as well as a basic grasp of many more complex ideas. 

I use a MIDI keyboard for recording at times and also really enjoy just noodling on piano (knowing a few keys well enough to sound like I know what I'm doing to a layperson). My ability to read music is definitely one of my weaknesses (having relied on tablature for guitar, and later simply going by feel), though I know how, just extremely slowly. The one other place I have largest difficulty is maintaining/coordinating different rhythms or patterns between both hands, since in guitar (USUALLY) both hands remain in sync. 

This got a tad long in explaining, but basically I'm just curious if anyone has any specific recommendations on where would be good for me to begin (whether books, videos, websites, pieces, etc) or any insights on similar experiences learning piano after guitar. I do honestly want to dive right into beginning learning a piece, but I am afraid I'll choose something where I'll run into an insurmountable difficulty, or something that'll be disappointingly unrewarding upon completion and while learning (though I understand that's indeed the nature of learning an instrument/anything).

20,piano,Any church musicians out there? Question about church piano use,"I'm a relatively new music director (10 months) at a church with a beautiful Steinway B model as our main and only piano in the sanctuary. 

Throughout the last two years, the church hasn't been used much, but now people are starting to use the church building more and more frequently. 

However, we have had lots of personnel changes in the last three years (all unrelated to each other), so no one is exactly sure about who is allowed to use the piano, and they're all referring to me. 

We usually charge for outsiders booking, but for congregation members I was on the mindset that as long as they ask it's okay. But now that I think about it, it's a 100k piano and we should probably be wary of letting anyone and everyone from the congregation use it. It's a mid to large size church (\~300-400 people).

28,piano,Piano vs Hockey comparison,"I thought this is a great example to show the correlation between playing actually pieces vs working specifically on techniques, as compared to playing hockey. 

To play hockey you need to know how to skate. But once you know the basics, even though you might not be good at it, you want to try actually play some hockey. If you‚Äôre too fixated on improving certain skating techniques thinking that without them, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to play, that‚Äôs ridiculous. And the more hockey you play, during which, your skating skills will naturally improve. Also, during which, you might discover what gaps are there that you need to fill in so you can independently work on these. 

This is the same with piano. Yes, certain techniques may require separate exercises to develop. But please, dig in to the pieces, try your best to tough it out. During this exercise is when you can truly discover what‚Äôs missing from your current technique. And by playing the music, you‚Äôre building your skills!",1646665793

Anyway, starting from bar 28, the left hand is playing a bass note before jumping over the right hand to play a melody note. What's weird is that I'd normally expect that to be included in the pedal so you have it staying in the sound, but it's been specifically left out of the pedalling. I think it's definitely deliberate since starting in bar 32 the bass does get included.


Does anyone know why it was written in this way? Like maybe a particular effect that's being achieved that I'm not picking up on? My only real guess is it's just to have a thinner sound, especially since we've suddenly jumped into a quiet section.",1646655375

9,piano,Learning music composition / comping through playing piano,"Hi everyone! I started learning piano some time ago with the idea of experiencing musing and composing songs.

I've finished Alfred Adult All-in-One book 1 and I'm currently near the end of book 2. At the same time, I've started Intro to Jazz by Mark Harrison to learn more about contemporary music and comping. So far, I've learned 3-7 voicings with doubling in all keys for major, minor and dominant 7th chords. I also learned all major and minor triads and their inversions and I'm planning to do the same with 4th parts chords once I'll have had fully digested triads.

So far so good, I'm getting more and more in control of the keyboard and I love this feeling. However on the composition side, I need advice on how to move forward. I'm really interested in making 80-90's sounding songs, lately I'm really into RnB ballads (as [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV8vB1BB2qc&amp;list=PL0NaUInSC7yBX7ciFsvAjiNBhyqu9pSIU) and I guess that [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYHDfJDPDc&amp;list=PL0NaUInSC7yBX7ciFsvAjiNBhyqu9pSIU) qualifies as RnB as well). I've taken a look at the Pop Piano Book by Mark Harrison and watched some Youtube tutorials on Neo Soul chord voicings and ballad comping. While all of this is useful to learn some patterns, it doesn't help when it comes to music composition. 

* How can I experience more with the piano to start playing the things that I hear ? Should I just try, fail, and learn through it ?
* Should I try making songs even if I don't have much idea about how to play what I hear ? 
* Could it help to find sheets for songs that I like and learn them until patterns become a part of my brain and hands ? 

I do feel that while I enjoy learning from books, nothing could be more enjoyable than actually learning a song that I like and trying things out (and keeping some time for books as well).

What kind of monitors/speakers do I need to play at home? Are the Clavia Nord Monitors any good? They are quite pricy...   
And is a stage piano and a monitor/speaker already enough to play? What else do I need?

Thank you so much for helping me out. :)",1646569644

21,piano,New adult pianist,"Hello Reddit,

I've recently taken an interest in learning piano.  I'm 33 years old and have played guitar for a number of years (No music theory knowledge though blame tablature for that).  Part of my interest comes from a place of wanting to learn musical theory and partly because I've always love the sound of the piano.

I've purchased a digital piano Casio PX-735 I don't know much about it but it was the right price sounded nice to my ear and has 128 polyphony and graded hammer action (as far as I know these two are must haves)

So my first question is should I get lessons straight away or should I get familiar and learn a bit first?

Should I get lessons at all?  Self taught on guitar but did develop bad habits.

Any beginner books or resources that are recommended to get started?",1646560719

I've prioritized my physical health over the last year, and between working out, work, spending time with my family, and making dinner every night I don't really have a ton of time at all to pursue hobbies. 

I bought an Xbox a few months ago, and I've been having a ton of fun playing it. It's instant gratification, unlike piano where you have to practice to get to where you want to be and to really have fun playing. There are moments when I play and I'm like ""man, I should really spend more time with this, because it's fun"", but I just don't know if the work is worth it. Especially since you have to practice consistency to keep your skills sharp and make real progress.

I know there are those who will say ""just play as much as you can, and don't worry about being the best or being great"". I agree with that, but at the end of the day if I have some free time, I find video games to be much more relaxing and worth my while. 

But then there are the times when I play at a party, play in front of friends and get compliments, or play in front my son and see him genuinely intrigued. In these times, I feel much more motivated to keep going, but I don't know what my main motivation is doing it for myself.

I returned to the piano after a 8 year hiatus and had some issues with tendonitis from overpracticing. My professor has been pushing for me to apply to a masters program.

First off, I don't think this breaks any rules but if it does, I apologize.

I want you all to know I was ***not*** paid to say any of this. I chose to write this because I'm a beginner piano player and I know how hard it is to find a good teacher. I also truly believe that so many people are missing out by not knowing about this course. The creator/instructor is seriously amazing. He's incredibly talented and he has helped me so much that I feel obligated to return the favor by writing this testimonial. I genuinely think this is the best piano course on the market. Or at least the best that I have found.

It's called [Flexlessons.com](https://flexlessons.com/) and I've been using it for about two months. The instructor's name is Joseph and he's the best teacher that anyone could ask for. You can tell how much work he's put into it by simply looking at how much content is on the site and how organized it is.

There are a ton of videos. Literally everything you could possibly need from complete beginner stage all the way to advanced. He tells you what books to get for each stage and what to focus on during your practice sessions. I'm currently working on some pieces in Masterworks Classics Level 1, a bit of sight reading per day, and some dexterity exercises. There are videos where he guides you through the exercises as well. There's also a page where you can post recordings of your playing and get feedback from Joseph and/or one of the members. You'll get feedback telling you if you're good to move on or if there are things you still need to work on.

I never write reviews but this is a million percent worth it. I'm actually so impressed with myself and how quickly I've advanced. I couldn't have done it without Joseph and his course. I give it an 11/10 and I recommend it to literally everyone. I'm really hoping I get to see more people in the community because it deserves it :)",1646497636

1. Shall I get a slab piano or a cabinet one. Is there that big difference in sound quality ? (P125, P515 vs Clavinova) noting that Clavinovas cost around 4x the P125 and 2x the P515 here.
2.  If I should head for a Cabinet one. Are the features in the CVP worth it or shall I head for the CLP and get the mixing and backing - if needed - by the computer ? Will it be of the same Quality ?. I like the looks and style of the CLP.

I am not into classical music for now. More into modern pieces that have back stage strings etc.",1646469740

2,piano,I want to quit piano lessons,"I've been playing the piano for 8+ years. I see it as a hobby but my mom sees it as a talent. She sends me to piano lessons and expects me to score distinctions in my piano exams. She gets mad, scolds and shouts at me when I make mistakes practising classical pieces. I also suck at music theory and can't sing well. I hate it so much because this puts a lot of pressure and stress on me, and I want to focus more on my studies to prepare for my final exams of high school. My mom wants to me to take a teacher's grade level exam but I don't see myself becoming a piano teacher in the future, so there's no point and no where to go with that achievement. 

I told her I wanted to quit piano lessons, she reacted negatively and refused to let me do so, and said I would let many years of experience and money go to waste :( 

One day, I told her I might pursue a music career, but she brushed the idea off and told me to pursue another I like, which confused me. Why would she want me to take the exam then? 

I think I might have lost my passion for piano. Now playing the piano feels more like a chore than a hobby. I thought of talking to my dad about it first, before telling my mom again. I also want to learn another instrument like bass or guitar.

7,piano,Is raising fingers high bad technique?,"Is it bad technique to have your fingers up high as they're about to play a note? I have developed this habit, that is most apparent when I'm doing this hand independance exercise that I've seen on youtube, where both hands are in C position and notes are played from left to right and then back to the left. As I'm playing my fifth finger on my right hand, I'll notice that my fourth and third fingers automatically raise up in anticipation to play their notes, sometimes I feel like it's going a little too high too.

Is this a problem? It hasn't really impacted my playing but that's probably because I'm still a beginner and practicing beginner material. When I see great pianists play on YouTube they usually have their fingers low at all times.

If it is considered to be bad technique, does anyone have any tips on how I could correct it?

I just wanted to stop in and give a quick recommendation for anyone interested in a piano course. First off, I was ***not*** paid to say this. I chose to do this on my own because this course is criminally underrated. I truly believe a lot of people are missing out. Seriously guys, the creator/instructor is amazing. He's helped me so much that I feel obligated to return the favor by writing this testimonial. I genuinely think this is the best piano course on the market. At least the best that I have found.

 It's called [Flexlessons.com](https://Flexlessons.com) and I've been using it for about two months. The instructor's name is Joseph and he's the best teacher that anyone could ask for. You can tell how much work he's put into it by simply looking at how much content is on the site and how organized it is.

There are a ton of videos. Literally everything you could possibly need from complete beginner stage all the way to advanced. He tells you what books to get for each stage and what to focus on during your practice sessions. I'm currently working on some pieces in Masterworks Classics Level 1, a bit of sight reading per day, and some dexterity exercises. There are videos where he guides you through the exercises as well. There's also a page where you can post recordings of your playing and get feedback from Joseph and/or one of the members. You'll get feedback telling you if you're good to move on or if there are things you still need to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

I never write reviews but this is a million percent worth it. I'm actually so impressed with myself and how quickly I've advanced. I couldn't have done it without this course. I give this course an easy 11/10 and I recommend it to literally everyone. I'm really hoping I get to see more people in the community because it deserves it :)",1646450398

Whenever I'm doing two handed scales I notice that my right hand is performing much slower compared to when it is on it's own, which I assume is because I'm trying to stay on an even pace with my left. 

What would be the main ways to get the left hand up to speed? Focus primarily on my left hand to make it faster on it's own? Or keep doing two handed scales and increasing the speed incrementally?

For reference I started piano in summer of 2020 and have tackled some intermediate to advanced pieces since but haven't really taken technique as seriously as I should until now. 

For reference as to what I can play, some of the works I have played are Chopin's: Raindrop Prelude, and Preludes in E minor, E major, B minor, A minor, C minor, and A major. I have played his Nocturnes in G minor op 37 no 1, E flat major op 9 no 2, and C minor op Posth no 21. I have played Beethovens Moonlight Sonata movement 1, and Pathetique movement 2. Bach's Sinfonia's no 11 in G minor, no 5 in E flat major and no 4 in D minor. Also, Debussy's Reverie

### Guidelines

If you're new to /r/piano, the Piano Jam is a monthly event where you get the chance to challenge yourself to work on a piece of music and share your playing with the community. Whether you're a beginner or expert, we'd love to hear you play! See the guidelines below and check out all the previous piano jams in the sidebar.

You are encouraged to share a recording (of YOU playing) in a post to /r/piano anytime during the month. **Please put ""Piano Jam"" post tag or ""[Piano Jam]""  somewhere in the submission title, so we know that's what the post is for. People have posted without this tag before and it's not the end of the world of course, but it does mean we might miss your submission!**

Please try to use YouTube / SoundCloud / Bandcamp for your links for accessibility &amp; reliability, but any links are allowed.

* You do not have to complete or perfect pieces to submit them, and don't be afraid to simplify/shorten pieces. Also, don't be afraid to improvise or write your own ending to a looped piece of video game music, etc.

* This is not a contest! It's a chance for you to set a goal for yourself and to share your journey and accomplishments with the /r/piano community.

* For classical pieces ABRSM grade estimate is in brackets - the source of estimation is [piano grade aggregator](http://pianosyllabus.com/default.php)

* You do not have to limit yourself to just one piece, you can submit as many as you like as long as they belong to the list.

* If you have pieces you would like to suggest for future Piano Jams, please use our [suggestion form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5U5DA0OjN1HeaK-5Ue_s92HeZ5ud_2OynMb0WoKt1BPPwrg/viewform).

* Late submissions are allowed. Your submission can be late up to two months, it has to be written in the submission title to which

I want to learn to play the piano and want to start with a decent one so I don't pick up any bad habits. I've browsed this subreddit looking at the different models and differents requirements my piano should meet and have more or less narrowed down my choice to two pianos.
The roland fp-30x and the casio px s1100
Considering I would probably thinking of getting a frame and pedals for both, which would be best ? Is the roland really that much better, it would probably cost about 250-300‚Ç¨ more. 
I've noticed this subreddit is also a big fan of the yamaha p-125 but I prefer the feel of the roland.
The casio sounded okay in the shop but am I missing something you guys might have noticed

82,piano,"Is there such a thing as ergonomic keyboards? In the same way as there's ergonomic computer keyboards, curvy and weird shaped? If not, why not?","It seems weird that pianos and digital keyboards are still, today, in the same rigid shape that physical acoustic instruments needed to be. We don't need to use so much pressure to push down a key anymore; we can use the same mechanical buttons used by swanky computer keyboards to barely touch a key in order to press it. We can use the ergonomic shapes of those same computer keyboards to put the keys closer together and in a different layout, instead of having to put them in a single line as history required of the physical instruments. Things no longer NEED to be the way they always have been....so why hasn't anything changed? Surely a piano keyboard that's in an ergonomic layout would be incredibly easier to play, since you don't have to splay out your hands and therefore hurt your joints. 

I get why performers wouldn't move to this, tradition is tradition, but why isn't there experiment in the casual market? Wouldn't it be much easier for kids and the consumer to fit a keyboard in their house, to use it regularly, if they didn't have to make space for a giant bar and have to lug that around? If all a person needed was a small little thing no bigger than a laptop? Let alone the gains for people with disabilities. I looked for ergonomic and even for smaller size keyboards; there aren't any ergonomics, and there's only very few special made 7/8 size keyboards, which isn't a great improvement. Ergonomic keyboards could even be hooked up to the same software that makes digital keyboards light up their keys to show you the correct notes, and to tell you when you're doing it wrong. I just feel like it's the difference between saying everyone has to have a supercomputer and engineering degree before they're allowed to use a computer vs the user friendly pocket toys called smartphones that practically everyone has now.",1646359305

Looking to spend about $500 just for some fun of learning another instrument, and to get some fire under me to learn to read music, rather than relying on tabs.  Used is even proffered to get more bang for buck, and if it doesn't stick to be able to recoup nearly the full cost. But I don't really quit instruments so I'm not worried about that. 

I'd like to be able to shape various sounds and tones,  I think that's standard on most keyboard with effects and what not. 

Headphone input, and internal speakers are a must. Again I think that's both pretty standard.  I'd like to also be able to play it though my stereo monitors. 

Good sound and good feedback are important.  I think what I'm referring to in terms of feedback is weighted keys, I don't want it to feel like a toy.

I need to focus on other things now; getting high enough grades to get admitted into uni and maintaining scholarships. I just dont feel like being 100% committed to piano practice every day and lessons now.

All my lessons are online over Skype now because of COVID, and tomorrow I plan on telling him.

I'm just struggling how to bring it up to him and what to say. I'm scared I'll make him feel sad because it's so sudden. Any tips?",1646274894

I‚Äôm an intermediate at guitar so I do have some music theory under my belt. I won‚Äôt be going in totally blind. I don‚Äôt have the money for an 88 key so I was lucky to get this one.

48,piano,Looking for advice - I've been asked to play piano at an airport fundraiser.,"Hi everyone. I've been playing some airport pianos during my travels and have now been asked if I could play some piano during an airport fundraiser in the fall where they raise money to fly special needs kids to Disney World. They've asked for two or three 20 minute sets while cocktails are being served. 

I've tentatively accepted as I'm happy to volunteer my time for this, but I'm looking for some advice. I'm a bit unsure of what I'm getting myself into, considering I'm not a pro and have never really played in any formal setting (if a few recitals over a decade ago even count). 

I think I'm the one choosing the music, so I was thinking of just finding some easy Disney song arrangements and learning them, given the Disney World theme. Nothing too loud or too complicated, more suitable for ""background"" music. Does that sound good? 

A work friend sings and we might perform together. I've never played piano accompaniment for voice before, but I should be able to find piano/voice arrangements fairly easily, I think. Practising together might be quite a bit of trial and error...

Given the setting, I can bring all my sheet music with me, right? It's not standard practice in the industry to have everything memorized for things like this, right?

Any other advice? Thanks in advance :)",1646270884

50,piano,Regaining interest after 2 decades,"Tl;dr played piano as a kid, want to pick it up again... Got a crappy keyboard at the moment, want to get a new one to get into a hobby, fear of losing interest and wasting money. 

*rant*

I have been away from piano for the better part of 2 decades and i am considering restarting.... The problems i have currently

1) i have a keyboard with a dead key from my child hood, and missing music sheet holder....so learning is a bit stunted. 

So that brings me to problem 2) i am considering getting an upgraded digital piano

Which is problem 3) i am afraid of losing interest again once i get it into my apartment. 

Any advice on how to proceed.... I would love to learn moonlight sonata by betoven.... But i looked at the sheet music and holy crap.... I don't think i could ever get that good to play that piece

I'd settle to work my way up to it, and do some intermediate work.

My major problem is just sitting down and doing it... Its like all my other hobbies (learning German, exercising, etc) i get really excited.... I do it for a time.... Then get bored/frustrated and quit. I don't want to spend an absurd amount of money just for the digital piano to collect dust

For some reason i really want to do this, it's a part of me that won't shut up. Call it lost passion, or boredom.... But this won't go away

Sorry for the long rant... I really need a constructive hobby.",1646269645
51,piano,Roland KPD 90 Pedal Board feeling weird?,"I got the FP-90X with pedal board. Now the right pedal (sustainpedal) feels different from the other two. While on the other two you just have to apply a continous force on them, the right pedal had this weird hardening once you half press it, I think it‚Äòs some kind of rubber or something that makes it harder to press when half pressed. I found this made it much more difficult to actually play precisely..
Is there a pedal from Roland that doesn‚Äòt have that? Is that even normal?
Right now I connected the sustain pedal input to one of the other two pedals.",1646269203

61,piano,Help understanding piano keys (newbie),"I tried a brand DEP-20 by Doner and then also the Yamaha P-45. Hands down the feel of the yamaha is much better. But the price point of the DEP is more in my range. What I also like is that the DEP has all three pedals while the P45 has sustain.

Ultimately, my decision is coming to the keys and the pedals. I need help identifying what I am feeling from touching and pressing down on the keys.

Both are weighted. But the Yamaha key feels gentler and it bounces back quicker. It‚Äôs smoother and so easy to use. The DEP keys are harder feel like they are heavier to press down and slower to come up.

What is this feeling I am getting called from the key presses?

The reason why I am asking this question is because I want 3 pedals of the DEP and I want the key feeling of the Yamaha.

How can I get both of these in one piano for a decent price range even if in the used market? Does this mean maybe going with a higher Yamaha brand like a P125?

Thank you for your help!",1646252507

After a cold shower and a couple of cups of coffee, I sat down to arrange the main theme ""Lux Aeterna"" for the piano (I know there are arrangements of it for the piano already, but I want to have my own spin on it). I usually write with Sibelius. When I went to choose the pedal option, I noticed something that I hadn't noticed before. There's an option called ""pedal life."" What's the difference between this and the usual ""pedal"" option? There are also ""pedal lift again"" and ""pedal lift finally.""

PS Is there a difference between ""pedal"" and ""pedal no line""? Sound-wise, they don't aren't different as far as I can tell. Is it just a dictation thing?",1646252240
